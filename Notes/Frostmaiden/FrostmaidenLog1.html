  <h2> 20210908 Session Notes </h2>
  
  
  <p>* **Farok** used *"Hold Person"* on **Avarice** to keep her from running away after threatening our group.</p>
<p>* **Conor** used *"Disintegrate"* and **Avarice** was left with 1hp.</p>
<p>* We let her flee thinking the harsh environment would finish her off.</p>
<p>* **Farok** sent his "Eye Book" up into the top floor of a 200ft tower to scout it out.</p>
<p>* He saw four (4) blue, humanoid creatures with longswords, they looked like guards.</p>
<p>* The blue creatures see the book, swing to attack it, their swords go right through as if the book is incorporeal.</p>
<p>* **Farok** continues to use the book to inspect the room and read an inscription from the ceiling. "First, shield thy heart with a shield of Netheroak"</p>
<p>* While standing around the bottom of the tower, waiting for **Farok** to scout with his book, we were attacked by a "Tomb Tapper!" A large creature with a huge mouth where it's stomach would be.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** and **Orikeo** attacked the creature, did some damage, then **Tyche** *"Banished"* it for us to get away from the area.</p>
<p>* Next we continued to ***"Y27"*** on the map, which was another tower. This one had a poster outside with the phrase "Experience the Dark Between the Stars." After investigation we found out it was a play being advertised.</p>
<p>* We find another nearby tower to search. **Conor** and **Orikeo** walk up to a podium on what looks like a stage. **Conor** picks up a wand, Ghostly figures of musicians appear, in their places to perform. **Conor** makes "Wisdom" checks, with advantage from **Orikeo**, and ends up conducting a great orchestra, that is very moving to the group.</p>
<p>* Next the group heads to ***"Y26"***, and we see stone statues that appear to have as much detail as people who were turned to stone. </p>
<p>* Moving to ***"Y28"*** we find another inscription, "Eighth: Stand firm in thy circle of death and consume poison."</p>
<p>* **Tyche** flew up into the tower at ***"Y28"*** and found a small Skycoach in a glass bottle! We took it for decoration.</p>
<p>* Next we traveled to ***"Y29"*** and see a hexagonal building, with the door slightly ajar.</p>
<p>* We all go in since it's open, and immediately see a room with six (6) Gnothics and roll for iniative!</p>
<p>* **Conor** cast *"Hypnotic Pattern"* on the group of Gnothics, five (5) of the six (6) failed the save and were hypnotized.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** thrust his 20ft long spear in the room to attack the one not hypnotized.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** finished off the one damaged by **Throkken**, and then attacked one of the hypnotized.</p>
<p>* **Farok** used *"Sunbeam"* on the one damaged by **Orikeo**, and ended up killing it and damaging one of the four (4) left.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** attacked the one damaged by *"Sunbeam"* with *"insert spell name here,"* and damaged it further.</p>
<p>* **Conor** attacks the one that is damaged and kills it, leaving three (3) still hypnotized.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** attacks and grapples one of the three (3) left, **Orikeo** attacks the one grappled by **Throkken** and kills it, leaving two (2) Gnothics.</p>
<p>* **Farok** casts *"Earthern Grasp"* on one of the two that are still hypnotized, and **Tyche** attacks the same one with *"Magic Missile."*</p>
<p>* **Conor** goes in the room and casts *"Ray of Frost"* to finish off the one attacked by **Farok** and **Tyche**.</p>
<p>* The group "dog piles" the last Gnothic and easily kills it.</p>
<p>* After beating the "Gnothic Puzzle," we look around and figure out we are in a museum.</p>
<p>* We see a huge, lifelike, worm statue in a glass case and decide to walk by it and head upstairs.</p>
<p>* In the room we come to, we see eight (8) portraits of eight (8) different figures, and write down all the names on the plaques under the portraits.</p>
<p>* On the ceiling of this room is a huge stained glass mural of a figure speaking to a crowd of people.</p>
<p>* Next we travel to ***"Y8"*** and come to an auditorium with eight (8) large stained glass windows overlooking, and a goblet with steam coming off of it sitting on a lectern in the middle of the auditorium.</p>
<p>* We discussed what to do, whether to drink it or not.</p>
<p>* **Farok** picked it up, while the rest of us were discussing, and drank from it.</p>
<p>* **Farok** can now cast the *"Presidigation"* cantrip for 24 hours.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** drank from the goblet and she received the ability to cast *"Blade Ward"* for 24 hours.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** drank and received the *"Dancing Light"* cantrip for 24 hours.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** drank and received the *"Minor Illusion"* cantrip for 24 hours.</p>
<p>* Next we headed to ***"Y7"*** after making a note to come back to the auditorium with the goblet so we can get more cantrips after the ones we have get used or worn off.</p>
<p>* Looking in the window at ***"Y7"*** we see a little tower sitting on a pedastal with four (4) *"Bigsby Hands"* hanging in the air, guarding the little tower.</p>
<p>* **Farok** used *"Dispel Magic"* and one of the hands disappeared.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** turned invisible, ran in the room, grabbed the little tower.</p>
<p>* We all saw a quick flash of light from the room and nothing else.</p>
<p>* After waiting for a few minutes and not seeing any indication of **Tyche**, we plan how to enter the room with the three (3) *"Bigsby Hands."*</p>
<p>* **Farok** turns into a mouse to ride in **Orikeo's** pocket. **Conor** then turns **Orikeo** and **Throkken** invisible.</p>
<p>* We successfully sneak in to the room with the little tower, and still have no indication **Tyche** is around.</p>
<p>* The group decides to grab the tower like **Tyche** was originally planning to do, and we are all transported into a room with three (3) Hags, on a demi-plane.</p>
<p>* While being transported, we see **Tyche** go by us in the opposite direction! At least we know she's still ok.</p>
<p>* Once everyone was transported, the Hags saw **Conor** through his stealth roll since he wasn't invisible, and the portal immediately closed, locking **Tyche** out from the rest of us.</p>
<p>* In the room, **Throkken** and **Orikeo** are invisible and not noticed in the corners, **Farok** drops *"Polymorph"* on himself to return back to his Goliath form, **Conor** is standing around.</p>
<p>* **Farok** was conversing with the Hags for a while, with **Conor** chipping in here and there. **Farok** and ended up saying "... let's kill this bitch!"</p>
<p>* Immediately after he said that, **Throkken** dropped his invisibility, and used his charisma to keep the conversation going and not start a fight.</p>
<p>* **Farok** kept talking to the Hags and he was getting more and more aggressive. However he also told the Hags that **Conor** was previously a phylactery for a Lich. Along with divulging a lot of information about **Conor's** health condition and the reason(s).</p>
<p>* Once learning that **Conor** was a phylactery, the Hags stepped forward to examine **Conor**.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** attacked the Hags as they approached **Conor**.</p>
<p>* **SESSION OVER!**</p>
