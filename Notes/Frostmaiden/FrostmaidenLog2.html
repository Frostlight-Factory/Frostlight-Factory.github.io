  <h2> 20210915 Session Notes </h2>
  
  
<p>* Start with interaction with Hag coven</p>
<p>* **Throkken** steps between **Farok** and the Hags to prevent a fight starting, and the Hags back down.</p>
<p>* **Conor** is physically looking worse and worse. He starts to turn black and one of his horns falls off like he is decaying.</p>
<p>* **Farok** and the Hags keep talking about them examining **Conor**.</p>
<p>* **Conor** tells **Farok** it's ok if they examine him, they can't do any worse than his mom did to him.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** and **Farok** communicate telepathically and argue about letting the Hags examine **Conor**.</p>
<p>*  **Farok** drops *"Hold Person"* on **Conor**.</p>
<p>*  One of the Hags notices a tattoo on **Conor** and says she can add something to it.</p>
<p>* **Conor** is hesitant at the Hag's offer, and **Throkken** speaks up to defend **Conor** from being under someone else's control.</p>
<p>* **Farok** then speaks up and asks details about what the Hag plans to do with **Conor's** tattoo.</p>
<p>* ***"DM info-dump about Night Hags"***</p>
<p>* **Conor** and the Hag make a deal. They clasp hands, all the light in the area goes out, everyone hears **Conor** screaming in agoinizing pain. The Hags chant and the light starts to get brighter and illuminate the area.</p>
<p>* The Hags do a series of checks to see what they can do to "heal" **Conor**.</p>
<p>* They figure out the scar, from the phylactery, is Netherese in origin.</p>
<p>* One of the Hags holds out a hand, and a book flies off the shelf to her.</p>
<p>* She reads something about the "Evil Divine Illness"</p>
<p>* Next they set up an alchemical experiment.</p>
<p>* **Conor's** tattoos which used to glow an icy blue, now glow red and look like burn marks.</p>
<p>* The Hags continue to do a ritual and create a glistening blue potion in their cauldron.</p>
<p>* **Conor** takes the potion, downs it like a frat boy chugging a beer. Using what strength he had left, he tries to steady himself from the potion. </p>
<p>* **Conor** now feels like he is fully rested, and has some dark magic connected to him. (Metagame - He now has 1 level of Warlock)</p>
<p>* Next one of our party members notices an inscription on the back wall of the Hags hut. It reads "Second, summon a flame in the palm of your hand."</p>
<p>* To leave the Hags and return to our plane, we have to pass by the three (3) *"Bigby's Hands"* again.</p>
<p>* **Conor** casts *"Invisibility"* on **Throkken**, **Farok**, and himself. **Orikeo** uses one of his charges for the Charm of Invisibility. We all make it by *"Bigby's Hands"* and meet back up with **Tyche**.</p>
<p>* With the group back together, we discuss what to do next, and who and how to kill them. Maybe summon a Tarrasque to take care of **Carla** for us.</p>
<p>* While discussing we are able to get a short rest.</p>
<p>* Next we travel to ***"Y9,"*** which is a tall building that looks like a library.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** sees a weasel type creature reading books, with a penguin being dragged around by a leather harness.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** and then **Tyche** talk to the weasel creature. While **Tyche** is talking to them, the penguin slides **Throkken** a note scratched onto a piece of leather with his beak.
<p>* The note says "Help me!"</p>
<p>* **Tyche** and **Farok** start reading through some of the books and discover a lot of lore about a lich in control of Ythrin.</p>
<p>* Then we talk to the weasel creature about letting the penguin go free. He argues against it, which unknowingly to him seals his fate.</p>
<p>* **Farok** *"Misty Steps"* in front of the weasel, **Throkken** grapples it, then **Orikeo** cuts the leather harness freeing the penguin from the weasel.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** then attacks the weasel, which tries to shield itself and that is *"Counterspelled"* by **Farok**.</p>
<p>* Next the weasel casts *"Banishment"* on **Throkken** and **Orikeo**.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** is banished, however **Orikeo** is to high CR to be banished.</p>
<p>* Then a Mexican-standoff with *"Counterspell"* </p>
<p>* The weasel tries to fly away and **Tyche** has dead aim with her *"Eldritch Blast"*.</p>
<p>* **Conor** tries *"Charm Monster"* on the weasel, but it's immune to charm effects!</p>
<p>* **Conor** then inspires **Tyche** with a song. (Bardic Inspiration)</p>
<p>* **Farok** casts *"Necrotic Blight"* on the weasel.</p>
<p>* As soon as his turn starts **Throkken** reappears to fight.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** uses his height and jumping distance to make one attack on the fleeing weasel.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** activates *"Tasha's Wordly Guides"* using the Upper Planes, then attacks with *"Eldritch Blast"*  and misses all her shots!</p>
<p>* **Conor** then casts *"Hex"* on the weasel before shooting his own *"Eldritch Blast"* at it.</p>
<p>* **Farok** casts *"Grovel"* which makes the weasel fall to his knees and grovel.</p>
<p>* With the weasel now on the ground of the second floor of the library, **Throkken** attacks with his spear.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** makes his way up the stairs to get to the weasel creature.</p>
<p>* The weasel casts *"Dimension Door"*, however **Farok** is ready with a *"Counterspell"* to keep the weasel from fleeing.</p>
<p>* The weasel tries to *"Counterspell"* **Farok** but is unsuccessful.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** and **Conor** then hit it with *"Eldritch Blasts"*, **Tyche** actually does some damage and **Conor** does force and necrotic damage.</p>
<p>* The weasel dies after **Conor's** last hit, **Conor** then seemingly absorbs the weasel's soul and appears to have been healed by it.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** searches the body and finds a spell book, and three (3) scrolls.</p>
<p>* We also found a "Chime of Opening" on the weasel's body. (AL legal item)</p>
<p>* Our party then communicates with the penguin, and the penguin gets attached to **Orikeo** after removing it's harness and giving it a health potion.</p>
<p>* We learn the penguin's name is **Kingsport**, and he gets on **Orikeo's** back to travel with us.</p>
<p>* We then find a journal the describes how the city of Ythrin fell. And it described a wand used by wizards and mages as well as how they extended their lives by preserving brains in jars.</p>
<p>* In times of trouble, the wizards and mages would create a magical bubble over the city which only they could pass through.</p>
<p>* By law, every wizard and mage in the city has to help keep it clean.</p>
<p>* An "Abb Cadab" can create food and drink among other things.</p>
<p>* Ythrin is governed by eight (8) wizards.</p>
<p>* When the wizards/mages graduate they select one of the eight (8) towers to join.</p>
<p>* They also like the "Chain-lightning" sport.</p>
<p>* They sell wonders at the bizarre in town, along with winged pets that have hair.</p>
<p>* Wizards/mages use "Magen" as guards</p>
<p>* They also use life force to make species live again</p>
<p>* Their meditation hall is invaluable to them.</p>
<p>* Finally after spending many hours going through the books, we decide to leave the library.</p>
<p>* Once we step outside we see two (2) familiar figures, and 20 cultists with them.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** is the first one outside, **Avarice** and **Vellanin** look at each other, then**Vellanin** starts to talk with **Throkken**.</p>
<p>* **Farok** joins the conversation as two (2) cultists are sent to enter the library. He immediately steps in front of them preventing entry to the library.</p>
<p>* ***ROLL INITIATIVE!***</p>
<p>* **Farok's** *"Cloud Kill"* , with force damage, was able to cast before initiative started.</p>
<p>* **Avarice** casts *"Counterspell"*, then **Farok** successfully *"Counterspells"* **Avarice's** *"Counterspell"*.</p>
<p>* *"Cloud Kill"* inflicts (Metagame - 18 points of) damage to most of the cultists.</p>
<p>* While the fight is starting, **Orikeo** does his best to hide and cover **Kingsport** from the commencing battle.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** flies up and casts *"Spell Jon didn't write down"* and kills one of the remaining cultists.</p>
<p>* **Farok** casts *"Blight"* immediately before **Avarice** moves out of the *"Cloud Kill"* area and casts *"Blight"* on **Tyche**. (Metagame - **Tyche** only took half damage from the save.)
<p>* **Conor** then attacks **Vellanin** with *"Hex"* and *"Eldritch Blast"*.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** *"Rages"*, moves through the *"Cloud Kill"* area, and grapples **Vellanin** and a random cultist.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** turns to put **Vellanin** and the cultist near a Flumph.</p>
<p>* **Avarice** runs out of the *"Cloud Kill"* area and casts *"Cone of Cold"* at **Farrok**, **Tyche**, and **Conor**.</p>
<p>* Cultists turn - they all run out of the *"Cloud Kill"* area.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** then (Metagame - fails one of the five (5) Wisdom saving throws) seems to stop moving as if he is held in place.</p>
<p>* The other cultists take their turn and one ends up paralyzing **Farok** which in turn stops the *"Cloud Kill"*.</p>
<p>* (Metagame - **Farok** rolls dice and stops the paralysis)</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** moves up, kills one of the cultists around **Farok** and badly injures another.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** then casts *"Hypnotic Pattern"* and it effects a lot of the remaining cultists. Then she flies over **Farok** and **Orikeo**, while still 20ft up off the ground.</p>
<p>* A bunch of cultists who are affected by *"Mass Suggestion"* all run to a random boulder on the ground.</p>
<p>* **Farok** casts *"Fireball"* at the boulder and kills all but three (3) remaining cultists.</p>
<p>* **Dasan** comes walking up behind **Avarice**.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** moves up and throws two (2) hand axes at the cultists who are just staring at the boulder.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** then attacks **Vellanin** who tries to cast *"Shield"* but is *"Counterspelled"* by **Farok**.</p>
<p>* **Dasan** steps towards **Vellanin** and looks like he is casting a spell.</p>
<p>* **Vellanin** starts screaming, then holds her head tightly in her hands while continuing to scream and fall to the ground in a fetal position. She keeps screaming and holding her head until she dies from the mental pain and anguish.</p>
<p>* **Conor** then casts *"Unsettling Whispers"* on **Avarice** before casting *"Disintegrate"*, which fails (Metagame - even after up-casting to a level 7 spell).</p>
<p>* **Throkken** is still held by a cultist and incapacitated at this time.</p>
<p>* **Avarice** casts *"Fireball"* at **Orikeo**, **Farok**, and **Throkken**. And it hurts.</p>
<p>* The last cultist who was staring at the rock, realized what was happening and just ran away.</p>
<p>* **Farok** casts *"Another spell Jon didn't write down"* but **Avarice** was able to move out of the way.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** then tries out a spell he was magically gifted and casts *"Dancing Light"* on **Avarice** to try and distract her since she is too far away to get in range for a melee attack.</p>
<p>* **Dasan** asks **Tyche** if he can have the last hit and finish off **Avarice**, to which **Tyche** is in agreement.</p>
<p>* **Avarice** grabs her throat as if she is choking, but we don't see anything around her. **Dasan** has cast *"Silent Image"* which brought **Avarice** to her end.</p>
<p>* ***DING! LEVEL UP!***</p>
