  <h2> 20210929 Session Notes </h2>
  
  
<p>* **Throkken** and **Orikeo** discuss taking a long rest in the library or an invisible tiny hut.</p>
<p>* **Dasan** and **Tyche** speak up about using her Genie lamp for a long rest.</p>
<p>* We all discuss where and how to take a long rest for way to long.</p>
<p>* While the group is busy discussing, **Dasan** picks up **Vellanin's** body, walks off to bury her as she was his grandmother.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** , using his increased size and strength, easily digs a hole for **Vellanin's** grave.</p>
<p>* As the party looks around at the results of battle, we notice the defeated cultists are frozen in place and all have a recognizable charm around their necks.</p>
<p>* Next we collect as many books from the library as we can possibly transport while **Throkken** overlooks **Dasan** saying the Last Rites while burying his grandmother.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** overhears **Dasan** mention the "Night Singer" during the rites and asks him about it.</p>
<p>* While **Dasan** is discussing what he can with **Throkken**, **Ongaku** walks up to our party.</p>
<p>* As we are in shock from seeing **Ongaku** seemingly appear from nowhere, **Dasan** speaks up and says he remembers watching **Ongaku's** body burn.</p>
<p>* **Ongaku** tells the party about the fugue plane his spirit was on, and how his god has allowed him to come back and help his friends complete their ultimate goal. He is wearing heavy golden armor with a veil covering his badly scared face.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** meets **Ongaku** for the first time, and they have a discussion.</p>
<p>* **Ongaku's** head is then flooded with everything the group has done, achieved, and accomplished during his absence. Almost as if his god inserted a ***"DM info-dump"*** into his brain.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** receives a message in his head from **Roscoe**, whom we haven't seen in this ruined town for a few days. The message tells us to meet at a tavern which isn't too far from our current location. **Orikeo** responds back that he's glad to hear from **Roscoe** and he'll get the group to meet at the tavern.</p>
<p>* Finally the group does whatever they can to burn down the library to keep **Karla** from getting any information at all.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** scryes to see **Roscoe** sitting at a table in a tavern with two (2) other humanoids around him.</p>
<p>* We head to ***"Y5"*** from ***"Y9"*** and see the tavern. **Dasan** says it's covered in illusion magic, runes, and sigils.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** is the first to the door, and opens it to see **Roscoe**, his druid master, and **Throkken's** mom, Bjornshield.</p>
<p>* **Ongaku** immediately casts *"Warding Bond"* on **Throkken**.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** is flying about 20 ft up and over the roof of the tavern.</p>
<p>* **Dasan** tells us how the illusions are working on this building.</p>
<p>* When **Throkken** sees his mom in the tavern, he says "Come out and fight!"</p>
<p>* **Ongaku** "And this is why I stayed dead for so long!"</p>
<p>* ***ROLL INITIATIVE!***</p>
<p>* **Throkken** rages, calls a Flumph to appear on the ceiling in the tavern, and tells **Roscoe's** master "Stay out of it."</p>
<p>* Next **Throkken** reaches in and successfully grapples to pull his mom out of the tavern. </p>
<p>* Acknowledging the deal that **Conor** and **Throkken** made in regards to their mothers, **Conor** inspires **Throkken** in a way that only a Bard could.</p>
<p>* **Roscoe** under the influence of his master, summons Kujo to damage us with fire and does his best to try and kill the party.</p>
<p>* **Roscoe's** master then casts *"Sunbeam"* which is *"Counterspelled"* by **Farrok** before he throws a *"Fireball"* into the tavern.</p>
<p>* After the fireball goes off in the tavern, **Orikeo** steps up and closes the door.</p>
<p>* Having been pulled outside, **Bjornshield** attacks **Throkken** with her greatsword.</p>
<p>* **Ongaku** uses a reaction to absorb all the cold damage that **Throkken** would have taken, but they both take slashing damage.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** tries to magically hold **Bjornshield** in place, however **Bjornshield's** will is too strong to be held.</p>
<p>* **Ongaku** uses an *"Aura of Vitality"*.</p>
<p>* **Dasan** tells **Orikeo** to move away from the door and he calls forth an invisible barrier to keep the door from opening.</p>
<p>* Two Frost Giant skeletons and winter wolves approach our party along with another druid.</p>
<p>* **Throkken's** Flumph is moved close to the Frost Giant skeletons while he punches his mom in the face.</p>
<p>* **Roscoe**, Kujo, and his master teleport out of the tavern, through the invisible barrier, to try and keep attacking the party. He then tries to *"Summon Fey"* but is *"Counterspelled"* by **Conor** and **Farrok**.</p>
<p>* The Flump blows up and damages the Frost Giant skeletons before they move up and one paralyzes **Orikeo** with it's gaze.</p>
<p>* **Bjornshield** then casts *"Wall of Fire"* on the party, of the five (5) people in range, only **Conor**, **Bjornshield**, and **Throkken** fail and take full damage.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** pulls out his magical floating spell book and uses it to attack the Frost Giant skeletons and **Bjornshield** with a chain of lightning.</p>
<p>* While **Throkken** is continuing to pin **Bjornshield**, she and the winter wolves attack him.</p>
<p>* Next **Tyche** flies up and *"Dispells"* whatever magic is affecting **Roscoe**.</p>
<p>* **Ongaku** hypnotizes one of the Frost Giant skeletons with a swirling pattern.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** is then hit by *"Moonbeam"* from the Frost Druid.</p>
<p>* **Dasan**, moves and *"Misty Steps"* to get in range to *"Firebolt"* the Frost Giant skeleton that is not hypnotized.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** releases his grapple on **Bjornshield**, then re-grapples her and holds her in the *"Wall of Fire"*. As soon as she start to take damage from the fire, she drops the fire wall.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** then summons and blows up his Flumph by them to try and damage his mom even further. </p>
<p>* **Conor** charms the Frost Giant skeleton that is not hypnotized.</p>
<p>* **Roscoe** attacks the Frost Druid and winter wolves with another lightning attack, then *"Flame Seeds"* his own master with Kujo.</p>
<p>* **Roscoe's** master then turns into an Air Elemental.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** attacks **Bjornshield** with *"Blight"*.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** attacks **Bjornshield** with *"Produce Flame"*.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** gets hit by **Bjornshield** and **Ongaku** takes some of the damage.</p>
<p>* Winter wolves then bite **Throkken**.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** creates a sphere of ice around the Air Elemental, trapping it.</p>
<p>* **Ongaku** whispers to **Bjornshield** "I think you fucked up." Then heals **Throkken** for 60 hp!</p>
<p>* Frost Druid tries to cast *"Ice Storm"* but is *"Counterspelled"* by **Farrok**.</p>
<p>* **Dasan** casts *"Wall of Force"* around the Frost Druid.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** jumps as high as he can, while holding **Bjornshield** up over his head, then lets her go and watches her body fall to the ground and take a lot of damage. He then grapples her again as she lies on the ground.</p>
<p>* **Conor** then whispers some *"Unsettling Words"* to **Bjornshield** before casting *"Disintegrate"* on her.
<p>* **Roscoe** calls forth another lightning attack on **Bjornshield** while **Throkken** takes more *"Moonbeam"* damage. Next Kujo is commanded to *"Flame Seed"*  **Bjornshield**.</p>
<p>* The Air Elemental bangs on the ice sphere to try and get out.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** casts *"Mind Slayer"* on **Bjornshield** before *"Misty Stepping"*.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** calls forth a *"Thunderwave"* which hits **Bjornshield** and one of the winter wolves. Then he action surges and attacks **Bjornshield** with three (3) long sword attacks.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** *"Eldritch Blasts"* **Bjornshield**.</p>
<p>* **Ongaku** heals **Throkken** again.</p>
<p>* Air Elemental moves the *"Moonbeam"* to **Dasan** and he takes a lot of damage.</p>
<p>* Now showing up to the battle is **Karla**, **Caradin**, and **Ned**.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** jumps again to get **Bjornshield** as high in the air as possible before letting her fall and take damage. Which kills her this time.</p>
<p>* **Roscoe** then cauterizes her body with flames.</p>
<p>* **Caradin** attacks and kills the charmed Frost Giant skeleton.</p>
<p>* **Conor** then whispers in a dissonant manner to a wolf, it tries to run away but dies.</p>
<p>* **Karla** tries to cast *"Time Stop"* but is thwarted by **Tyche** with her *"Counterspell"*. So then **Karla** attacks the wolf.</p>
<p>* Air Elemental attacks and breaks through the ice sphere, but takes damage in doing so. As it moves, **Roscoe**, Kujo, and **Conor** all take damage and Kujo is thrown against the wall of the tavern.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** and **Orikeo** attack the last wolf.</p>
<p>* **Ned** moves up to attack the last Frost Giant skeleton and calls forth his *"Spirit Guardians"* to help him. </p>
<p>* Frost Druid then casts *"Moonbeam"* on **Dasan**.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** casts *"Wall of Ice"* again, this time in a line.</p>
<p>* **Ongaku** moves up and talks to **Karla**, without taking a hostile action.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** attacks and kills the last wolf.</p>
<p>* **Caradin** attacks and kills the last Frost Giant skeleton.</p>
<p>* **Conor** moves and dashes to get next to his mom and **Ongaku**.</p>
<p>* **Karla** flies up 30 ft and asks **Tyche** to drop *"Ice Wall"*. **Tyche** does, then **Karla** casts *"Feeble Mind"* on the Air Elemental.</p>
<p>* The Air Elemental, runs, dashes, takes an op attack from **Throkken** as it turns back in to her Druid form and hops on a Roc to fly away.</p>
<p>* **Karla** says she wants to talk to the group in the tavern. They all go inside except **Orikeo** keeping watch at the door.</p>
<p>* While talking, **Oyoa** emerges from the back room of the tavern, **Throkken** and her start talking right away.</p>
<p>* **Karla** kept talking, ending the conversation with "I just want to be friends."</p>
