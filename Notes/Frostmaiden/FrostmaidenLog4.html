  <h2> 20211013 Session Notes </h2>
  
  
<p>* Start with **Farrok** and **Conor** talking, with **Throkken** chiming in to say "We can't trust Karla!"</p>
<p>* **Conor** responded saying the Frost Maiden doesn't stand a chance if we ally with **Karla** for the fight. Followed up immediately saying that we should double cross **Karla** as soon as we get the chance. And, "We need to find the obelisk."</p>
<p>* **Farrok** starts talking with **Karla** and she tries to exchange **Caradin** for **Conor**. During negotiations, **Farrok** names every other party member, except **Conor**, while discussing the exchange. **Karla** gets visibly perturbed.</p>
<p>* **Conor** agrees to go with his mother and **Caradin** joins our group. </p>
<p>* **Tyche** convinces **Conor** to sign her book, then she stealthily cuts some of his hair to use for scrying later.</p>
<p>* We notice as a group that **Dasan** and **Ongaku** have walked off and left the party.</p>
<p>* After a lengthy debate about taking a long rest with **Karla** nearby, she promises no disturbances during our rest, we reluctantly agree to rest with **Karla** around.</p>
<p>* **Caradin** and **Conor** eye each other as they pass while switching parties.</p>
<p>* Next we head to ***"Y10"*** , and get to know **Caradin** on the way.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** grabs his beard, we "relearn" that **Caradin** worships Shar. **Farrok** and **Caradin** talk about Shar.</p>
<p>* **Caradin** pulls out his sword, and it ignites in black flame.</p>
<p>* We all talk to and learn more about **Caradin**</p>
<p>* After fist bumping **Caradin**, **Orikeo** saw a terrifying/frightening vision and immediately ran away from **Caradin**</p>
<p>* We arrive at ***"Y10"*** and see a huge tree. **Farrok** sends his book above the tree, and the tree swings at the spell book.</p>
<p>*  ***ROLL INITIATIVE!***</p>
<p>*  **Tyche**, **Farrok**, and **Throkken** all take a turn attacking the Treant before **Caradin** moves up, ignites the black flame on his sword, and completely demolishes the Treant.</p>
<p>*  **Throkken** carved a wand out of the Netheroak Treant, and gave it to **Farrok**. **Orikeo** and **Tyche** both carve a wand of their own from the Netheroak Treant.</p>
<p>*  Next we head to ***"Y11"***</p>
<p>*  **Tyche** flies up to check it out and sees a sphere of eyes down inside the ruined tower.</p>
<p>*  **Farrok** sends his book down to the sphere and sees a plaque that reads "Ask and we shall find".</p>
<p>*  A few of us ask questions, and the eyes in the sphere appear to only nod "yes" or "no."</p>
<p>*  **Farrok** touches the sphere and asks "Where is **Karla**?" We see one of his eyes start to get pulled from it's socket towards the sphere, and he sees **Karla** and **Conor** casting spells at a yellow magic shield. His eye goes back in the socket, and is black and blue as if he got punched in the face.</p>
<p>*  **Throkken** walks up, touches the sphere and whispers "Scroll of Tarrasque." His eye does get pulled out of it's socket and joins the others in the sphere, and he received no answer to the whereabouts of the scroll.</p>
<p>*  **Caradin** touches it and asks a question that no one else can hear. Then we move on.</p>
<p>*  Arriving at ***"Y12"*** we see a long, deep well and a couple of benches. </p>
<p>*  **Orikeo** sits on a bench, and is connected to the energy surrounding the well. He sees a wizard with a bejeweled staff and book walk out onto a balcony overlooking a large crowd. The tower looks like the tower in the center of town.</p>
<p>*  **Farrok** sends his book down the well, sees a large tentacle.</p>
<p>*   ***ROLL INITIATIVE!***</p>
<p>*   **Farrok** successfully banishes the Hydra at the bottom of the well, and we make haste in leaving the area.</p>
<p>*   Arriving at ***"Y13"*** we see an old marketplace with most of the area in ruins. A headless construct is rampaging around randomly swinging and hitting wildly. His head we saw back in the caves of hunger.</p>
<p>*   We decide the best way to search the area is to dispatch the construct first.</p>
<p>*   **Farrok** grapples the construct with *"Bigsby's Hand"*, then **Roscoe**, **Throkken**, **Tyche**, **Orikeo**, and **Caradin** all take turns attacking and ultimately killing the construct.</p>
<p>*   We search the area that is not in ruins, we find guard like statues, and a shop with large spiders on the ceiling spinning silk around a platform.</p>
<p>*   Intricate silk robes are seen on mannequins in the back of the store, and the merchants appear to be automatons.</p>
<p>*   **Throkken** walks in and starts asking questions to the merchants.</p>
<p>*   **Orikeo** stands on the platform while **Throkken** is trying to communicate with the automatons.</p>
<p>*   The spiders descend around **Orikeo** and create an intricate robe with a scene from his early childhood, fishing with his father and a large trout biting his finger.</p>
<p>*   **Tyche** gets on the platform after **Orikeo's** robe is finished and receives a custom robe herself.</p>
<p>*   **Farrok** stands on the platform, starts talking about his robe, and the merchant asks if he is intoxicated.</p>
<p>*   **Tyche** asks for another robe, is denied, then she uses a fake mustache and asks again to which she is able to receive another robe.</p>
<p>*   **Throkken** stands on the platform to get a robe as well, however he is asked his ancestry and then told that he is a "slave race" and asked where his master is.</p>
<p>*   **Farrok** gives **Throkken** his robe.</p>
<p>*   Onward to ***"Y15"***</p>
<p>*   **Orikeo** walks up to the door and the automatons greet and let him inside. </p>
<p>*   **Throkken** and **Roscoe** walk up to the door and are denied access because they are "slaves."</p>
<p>*   **Farrok** walks up, and convinces the automatons that **Throkken** and **Roscoe** are our slaves so they are allowed in with us.</p>
<p>*   **Caradin** does a lot of damage to a door that is welded shut. </p>
<p>*   **Tyche** *"Firebolts"* the door before **Throkken** ultimately hits it open.</p>
<p>*   We see a frog-like creature in wizard robes, he slashes at **Farrok**!</p>
<p>*   ***ROLL INITIATIVE!***</p>
<p>*   **Throkken**, **Roscoe**, and **Orikeo** attack the Slaad before it attacks **Farrok** again.</p>
<p>*   **Throkken** attacks one more time before **Tyche** kills it with *"Produce Flame"*.</p>
<p>*   **Orikeo** walks up to another Slaad looking through a telescope, it hisses at **Orikeo** and he screams back in it's face, un-intimidated.</p>
<p>*   **Throkken** pins and restrains the Slaad allowing **Tyche** an easy target.</p>
<p>*   The Slaad frightens **Throkken** and **Orikeo**.</p>
<p>*   While **Roscoe** is *"Thornwhiping"* the Slaad, **Throkken** and **Orikeo** are running away, frightened.</p>
<p>*   **Tyche** hits and runs before the Slaad throws a *"Fireball"* at **Farrok** and **Roscoe**.</p>
<p>*   **Roscoe** *"Thornwhips"* one last time before **Caradin** crits and finishes off the Slaad.</p>
<p>*   We search and find another phrase "Third, a burnt palm loosens the tongue."</p>
