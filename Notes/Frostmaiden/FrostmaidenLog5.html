  <h2> 20211020 Session Notes </h2>
  
  
<p>* We start in a tower at ***"Y15"*** with two (2) dead Slaads, and another phrase to record.</p>
<p>* Heading to ***"Y16"*** we have a lengthy discussion about taking a long or short rest, and whether we even need a rest.</p>
<p>* **Caradin** tells **Farrok** he looks like he needs a long rest.</p>
<p>* We hop in **Tyche's** Genie Bottle and relax in a Hookah circle for a while.</p>
<p>* A discussion is brought up about **Throkken's** missing eye.</p>
<p>* While we rest, **Caradin** and **Oyea** are just waiting for us outside the Genie Bottle.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** starts to cast a spell when we emerge from the rest, and **Caradin** asks if he is casting a spell on him. **Farrok**avoids answering the question directly while casting *"Rory's Bond"* on the party members. And technically **Caradin** is not a party member, lol</p>
<p>* **Oyea** turns to **Throkken** and asks if he wants to be a Were-bear!</p>
<p>* While **Throkken** is thinking about it, and trying to get more info from her about the change, she asks **Farrok** and **Orikeo** if they would like to be one as well since we are her kin being Goliaths.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** declines the offer, and both **Throkken** and **Orikeo** are thinking hard about it. No need for an immediate decision.</p>
<p>* While continuing to ***"Y16"***, **Oyea** sneaks into an ally with **Throkken** and **Roscoe**, bites **Throkken** pretty hard, **Roscoe** heals the wound.</p>
<p>* After hearing what sounded like a bear mauling someone, **Caradin** asks if everyone is good.</p>
<p>* Arriving at ***"Y16"*** we see a large dome with tiny landscape environments inside. Many different biomes. **Roscoe** talks about walking right in.</p>
<p>* We see some large vials, a control panel and a lever. After searching we figure out we need to "donate" blood to the vials. **Orikeo** and **Oyea** each give 30 hp worth, **Farrok** gives 11, and **Throkken** gives up 9. Which totals the 80 we need.</p>
<p>* After pulling the lever, a green haired baboon appeared, talking to us.</p>
<p>* Verbal shenanigans ensued with the green haired baboon before we took him with us to ***"Y17"***</p>
<p>* We see a theater set up for a play, and immediately go backstage to the office where we find a play that **Tyche** reads and five (5) scripts that **Throkken** broke out of a locked desk.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** reads "Martyr", **Tyche** reads "Bewitched", and **Throkken** reads "Fools."</p>
<p>* After reading, we find out the scripts are cursed! Luckily no one suffers ill effects and **Orikeo** and **Throkken** keep their scripts.</p>
<p>* While we are searching the backstage office, **Caradin** and **Farrok** are outside, talking. **Caradin** asks **Farrok** to join him and **Karla**. And does a decent job of trying to convince him to join them.</p>
<p>* Next at ***"Y18"*** we see a toppled tower with a ruined base. A spectral ghost figure hovers over thousands of hands scrambling to move the rubble.</p>
<p>* The ghost is trying to recover his body, and the hands are all he has to move the stones. **Orikeo** jumps in and starts to help excavate the body, followed by everyone else jumping in to help.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** and **Farrok** turn into giant apes to help make the process move quicker.</p>
<p>* We recover the body and **Roscoe** acquires a necklace of *"Fireball"* beads.</p>
<p>* We also find another phrase "Seventh, trace a circle with the ashes of the dead."</p>
<p>* Leaving ***"Y18"*** we see **Karla** getting frustrated and flinging spells wildly at the yellow magic bubble. Seeing this, we by-pass her and head to ***"Y20"***.</p>
<p>* This tower is intact and has a huge axe blade sticking out of the top.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** walks up and opens the door to see a staircase winding to the top of the ice covered interior.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** walks up on the outside of the tower using his new Were-bear abilities.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** lights the brazier in the center of the bottom of the tower, and the interior starts to melt.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** notices figures in alcoves as the ice melts and warns us to stop the melting!</p>
<p>* Instead, we keep the brazier lit and **Tyche** *"Firebolts"* the ice covered phrase to help melt the ice faster so we can read it.</p>
<p>* To expedite the process further, **Roscoe** uses one of his newly acquired *"Fireball"* beads to destroy the ice around the phrase so we can get it and get out of the tower before the figures are free from their icy tombs.</p>
<p>* "Fifth, quench the flame in thy palm with ice."</p>
<p>* After obtaining the phrase we head to ***"Y21"*** , which is a 60ft tall black obelisk covered in Necromancy and Time runes.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** and **Tyche** each put their staffs in the opening and the only response is some vibration. **Tyche's** appears to vibrate more than **Farrok's**.</p>
<p>* The Professor Orb then informs us we need the Necromantic staff from the wizard who opened the city.</p>
<p>* Learning that, we head to ***"Y22"*** which is an Obsidian tower.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** walks up the outside of the tower, looks in the window at the top and sees purple mist.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** flies up and sees through the tower's illusion. It's completely in shambles and ruined, but the purple mist is still there.</p>
<p>* **Tyche**, **Roscoe**, and **Farrok's** spell book all go into the mist.</p>
<p>* While **Roscoe** is taking damage **Tyche** is reading and writing down the real phrase "Sixth, show thy face to the sky" she sees through the illusion.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** throws a rope into the mist to try and pull **Roscoe** out.</p>
<p>* All back outside, and healing **Roscoe** a little bit, we head to ***"Y23"***.</p>
<p>* Another large tower, this time with a pink light coming out of the top window.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** walks up the outside and sees what looks like a lady sitting on a throne with a phrase on the back wall.</p>
<p>* "Fourth, coax a secret from another."</p>
<p>* **Farrok** goes in the room and tries to talk to her. She appears stunned and unable to move or respond. He removes the crown from her head, and as she is falling to dust she says "Destroy the crown!"</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>The Two Hour Battle of **Caradin**</p>
<p>* Upon learning the last few phrases with our help, **Caradin** tries to leave us and report back to **Karla** with what he's learned.</p>
<p>* As he is turning to walk away, **Orikeo** whips him with a vine of thorns, to which **Caradin** shrugs off as if he was ready for a fight.</p>
<p>* **Oyea** and **Throkken** attack **Caradin**, then he hits **Throkken** in retaliation.</p>
<p>* **Roscoe** and **Orikeo** attack **Caradin**, then **Farrok** summons something and runs away.</p>
<p>* **Oyea** attacks again before **Throkken** grabs **Caradin** and climbs up the wall to drop him to the ground.</p>
<p>* **Caradin** attacks and **Roscoe** drops to the ground. </p>
<p>* **Tyche** squeezes in an attack while **Orikeo** moves over to heal **Roscoe** and **Farrok** calls *"Bigsby's Hand"* to grapple and crush **Caradin**.</p>
<p>* While grappled, **Caradin** lands a killing blow on **Roscoe**.</p>
<p>* As a new strategy, **Tyche** is going to fly across the room towards **Caradin**, **Farrok** is going to throw the cursed crown to her on the move, and **Orikeo** is to impose disadvantage on **Caradin** when the crown touches him.</p>
<p>* The plan worked! But **Caradin** is immune to any charm spell that is radiated from the crown.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** and **Oyea** attack before we see **Throkken** change into a Were-bear for the first time!</p>
<p>* **Tyche**, **Orikeo**, **Farrok**, **Oyea**, and **Throkken**, as a Were-bear, all attack **Caradin** with advantage since he is still grappled by the hand.</p>
<p>* **Caradin** attacks what would ultimately be his last time and kills **Farrok**!</p>
<p>* **Tyche** and **Orikeo** each get off one more attack before **Throkken** finishes him off with massive claw attacks.</p>
