  <h2> 20211027 Session Notes </h2>
  
  
<p>* Start with **Roscoe** and **Farrok** dead on the ground as a mysterious person is walking towards us.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** "rages" at the deaths of his friends and with nothing but adrenaline running through him, he asks **Oyea** to bite him!</p>
<p>* As the mysterious person gets closer we see that it's **Karla** accompanied by **Ned**!</p>
<p>* **Karla**, already knowing what we did to **Caradin**, shouts in a booming voice "WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!"</p>
<p>* **Karla** moves up  to **Throkken**, grabs her necklace, reaches out a hand to touch **Throkken**, who in immediate response grabs the upper half of **Caradin's** corpse and swings it in her face.</p>
<p>* **Karla**, un-phased, ultimately grabs **Throkken's** throat and whispers "Shadowfell", and **Throkken** is planshifted to the Shadowfell!</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** attacks **Karla** and being blinded by the anger of his fallen friends misses with every swing of his sword.</p>
<p>* **Karla** then looks at **Oyea**, snaps her fingers, and **Oyea** falls to the ground, dead!</p>
<p>* **Tyche** flies 60ft up and starts to cast some illusion around herself.</p>
<p>* While fighting **Karla**, we see in the distance a white dragon flying in towards the conflict. As it gets closer we recognize **Sig** in his original Goliath form, and **Conor** riding in on the dragon.</p>
<p>* **Karla** attacks the dragon with *"Shadowbolt"* and only does a little damage.</p>
<p>* **Conor** yells "Grab the dead!"</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** grabs the two closest fallen, which happen to be **Farrok** and **Oyea**.</p>
<p>* As soon as **Tyche** grabs **Roscoe**, **Conor** teleports all of us to a large tower, far away from **Karla**.</p>
<p>* **Sig** uses his hands and a "light touch" to bring **Oyea** back to life, and **Conor** uses a couple of scrolls to bring **Roscoe** and **Farrok** back as well.</p>
<p>* **Conor** then asks if we found the all ritual steps needed to access the tower.</p>
<p>* We start the ritual, and when a secret is needed, **Roscoe** says "**Farrok** is really gay!"</p>
<p>* **Throkken** starts the ritual a second time and **Roscoe's** secret this time is that he helped his master kill people he "probably" shouldn't have.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** puts ice on the flame, **Orikeo** burns a fish for ashes, **Farrok** uses the mayo jug to make the needed poison. **Sig** performs the ritual, and takes the last Anti-toxin potion that **Orikeo** had as well.</p>
<p>* After we make it inside the barrier, we see **Karla** banging on the outside.</p>
<p>* As we make our way up to a room in the tower, we hear "Who enters my tower?"</p>
<p>* We are all immediately knocked prone as we enter the lair of **Insert dramatic name Jon didn't write down**.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** and **Roscoe** hear in their heads "You should leave." And they both turn around and start to walk out.</p>
<p>* With a combination of slivers penetrating it's mind from **Farrok** and **Tyche's** missile's of magical damage, the creature falls dead.</p>
<p>* When it gets quiet after the last fight, we hear faint music and start to see aberrations holding candy.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** can't resist with her sweet tooth and grabs a piece, and as soon as she does, they all scream at us with such a painful tone we actually feel hurt from it.</p>
<p>* As we continue up the tower, we see three (3) brains hanging out in jars.</p>
<p>* **Conor** charms two (2) of them and directs us to attack the one not charmed.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** and **Tyche** quickly dispatch the first one.</p>
<p>* **Sig**, **Farrok**, and **Oyea** take care of the second jar holding a brain.</p>
<p>* Finally **Roscoe** and **Conor** do enough damage to the last one for **Orikeo** to finish it off with a swift blow from his longsword.</p>
<p>* We find ourselves in a grand but empty ballroom. **Orikeo** and **Sig** get a chance to talk about **Sig** not only coming back to life, but coming back in his original form since the last time they were together **Sig** was a Kobold.</p>
<p>* Then **Roscoe** and **Orikeo** listen to a few doors before opening them. </p>
<p>* As we check the offices behind the doors, **Conor** and **Sig** talk secretly to each other. We find some scrolls and an *"Abbracadabracadabracadabra!"* (AL legal item that probably needs clarification.)</p>
<p>* We open another door and see frozen ruins and a bunch of 12,000 year old wine, still bottled.</p>
<p>* The last door opens to three (3) diverging hallways. **Farrok** sends his magical, flying, seeing, spell book down one to investigate.</p>
<p>* While the spell book is investigating with us at a safe distance, **Sig** opens another door and sees a suit of armor with a brain in a jar sitting where the head would be.</p>
<p>* Upon communicating mentally with it, **Sig** and **Tyche** discover he is **Vederanda**, a Wizard from this city who put his brain in a suit of armor to live longer than his flesh body would last. He needs a particular staff from someone up higher in the tower for his experiments. We agree to get the staff for him.</p>
<p>* After more searching on this floor, we take a long rest.</p>
<p>* ***DING! LEVEL UP!***</p>
<p>* Next we use our powers combined to all get across a 35ft gap and through a small window safely and without any harm.</p>
<p>* We see 11 alcoves, and a figure appears, **Everlast**, who was created by **Ithorus**.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** engages **Everlast** and asks a LOT of questions.</p>
<p>* Getting seemingly nowhere with **Everlast**, **Sig** notices a hatch in the ceiling, flies up to it.</p>
<p>* Upon looking through the hatch, he sees two (2) floating swords in front of a door.</p>
<p>* We all get up the hatch, to engage the swords and  ***ROLL INITIATIVE!***</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** seems to change his shape wildly into that of a Polar Bear, while **Conor** gives the party Aid in the form of +35hp (for 8 hours), and inspires **Sig** in a way that only a Bard could.</p>
<p>* **Sig** and **Roscoe** attack the floating swords before they retaliate and attack **Sig**.</p>
<p>* **Oyea** and **Tyche** attack next and **Tyche** get the killing blow on one of them.</p>
<p>* The mental damage done by **Farrok** is enough to finish off the other floating sword.</p>
<p>* While **Tyche** and **Roscoe** search a glowing crystal, **Farrok** shoots a bolt right passed them to a green crystal, and it shatters.</p>
<p>* **Sig** and **Tyche** check a door for traps before we walk through, however after passing through a few of us trigger a Rune trap and start to turn to stone!</p>
<p>* We also see eight (8) doors, one seemingly for each school of magic in the universe.</p>
<p>* All of a sudden it gets so dark we can't see our own hands right in front of our face.</p>
<p>* Then while in complete darkness, we see a female figure walking seductively towards us.</p>
<p>* She says something.</p>
<p>* (We think it's an aspect of Shar that was pretending to be Selune to us the whole campaign)</p>
