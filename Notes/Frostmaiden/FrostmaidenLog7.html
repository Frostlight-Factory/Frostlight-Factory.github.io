  <h2> 20211103 Session Notes </h2>
  
  
<p>* **Karla** attacks the dragon with *"Shadowbolt"* and only does a little damage.</p>
<p>* **Conor** yells "Grab the dead!"</p>
<p>* Begin with **Orikeo** confused about Shar masquerading as Selune and intercepting the communication between us and Selune. He talks to **Sig**, his father, about this revelation and questions their worship to a false diety.</p>
<p>* **Sig** tries to use *"Divine Intervention"* but with the recent revelation it fails due to Selune being his diety of choice.</p>
<p>* **Sig** then says the name of **Conjurer Demouranth** and one of the eight (8) doors open.</p>
<p>* Looking in the opened door, he sees a vortex of glowing stars, rotating in the middle of the room and eight (8) high back chairs, each with one of the symbols for the schools of magic.</p>
<p>* We also notice constellations on the ceiling and a large black star in the middle, where no star exists in today's sky.</p>
<p>* Upon looking at the black star, a few of us become afraid to look at the night sky because the Ebon star might be looking back.</p>
<p>* Next we introduced our characters for the streaming audience.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** then mentally told us she wants to "Get the fuck out!"</p>
<p>* After some searching, we find books on the ground around the high back chairs. **Tyche** begins to read one and finds out the door to **Ithorus's** chamber only opens if three (3) or more of his apprentices sit in the high-back chairs.</p>
<p>* We also find and **Farrok** identifies a *"Scroll of Commet"*, which is a level 11 or 12 legendary spell from before **Mystra**.</p>
<p>* As a group we discuss how and when to strategically use the scrolls to summon a Tarrasque and a Commet as a boss CIA move.</p>
<p>* **Sig** looks around more while we are discussing the scrolls.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** decides now is a good time for some tricks, and magically pulls a panther out of her bag!</p>
<p>* **Conor** looks closer at a crack in the wall that seemed to drain the magical essence from magical items placed near by.</p>
<p>* The group hides around a corner and watches as **Farrok** places a hand on the crack. The crack was powerful enough to extract a whole spell slot from him!</p>
<p>* **Roscoe** shoots a *"Firebolt"* at the crack and the bolt is completely consumed.</p>
<p>* He keeps shooting and each and every bolt is consumed by the crack.</p>
<p>* **Conor** lock picks a double door, it opens to a balcony which overlooks the city.</p>
<p>* **Farrok**, **Orikeo**, and **Tyche** sit in the three chairs with symbols that match the cantrips they received in another building earlier, and a portal opens up to **Ithorus's** chamber.</p>
<p>* **Sig** is the first through, **Farrok** is pushed through by **Orikeo** when he asks to hold hands to go through the portal.</p>
<p>* We see a chamber that hasn't been disturbed for centuries. There is a large gap and three (3) one-eyed creatures on the other side.</p>
<p>* Looking closer we see a floating skull with runes forming above it. It's a demi-lich!</p>
<p>* ***ROLL INITIATIVE!***</p>
<p>* **Conor** goes first and hypnotizes the Gnothics with a pattern. And inspires **Orikeo** in a way only a Bard can.</p>
<p>* Demi-lich gives us all lair damage! And then makes us all take a Con save.</p>
<p>* **Sig** drops to the ground, then immediately starts breathing again because his name is in **Tyche's** book.</p>
<p>* **Conor** also drops to the ground then is surrounded by the Gnothics.</p>
<p>* Another Con save for everyone.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** uses darkness to hide and fly up.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** moves up to grab **Conor** and get him safely away from the Gnothics. In the process, **Orikeo** draws attacks from the Gnothics.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** moves up and uses a chain-force-lighting to hit all the Gnothics and the Demi-lich.</p>
<p>* The Gnothics are obliterated from **Farroks's** attack!</p>
<p>* **Roscoe** next via voice chat, summons Kujo next to the Demi-lich and he takes fire damage. Then he heals **Conor**.</p>
<p>* **Sig** then heals himself.</p>
<p>* The Demi-lich uses a legendary action and now Kujo is blinded!</p>
<p>* A gold orb moves towards **Orikeo** and a golden rectangle tries to consume the space where he is standing.</p>
<p>* **Oyea** moves up as far as she can before the Demi-lich moves towards her and tries to suck her life force.</p>
<p>* Next **Orikeo** is cursed!</p>
<p>* **Tyche** says the liches name and then uses a spell from Fizban.</p>
<p>* **Roscoe** and Kujo then take turns attacking the Demi-lich with as much fire damage as they can.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** seeing how good fire damage is, uses his inner-druid to produce flame, hit the Demi-lich, then move into the darkness before getting rid of the curse.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** uses *"Bigby's Hands"* to hold and try to crush the Demi-lich.</p>
<p>* **Sig** calls forth his spiritual weapon which is a goblin with an old timey news hat and newspaper which says "Liches Suck!" in Draconic.</p>
<p>* The golden orb that was near **Orikeo** moves towards **Farrok** and successfully swallows him into a Demi plane with two (2) flesh golems and three (3) magen.</p>
<p>* They all ***ROLL INITIATIVE!*** against **Farrok**, he immediately shields as much of their attacks as he can.</p>
<p>* **Conor** attacks the demi plane as the Demi-lich moves into the darkness cast by **Tyche**.</p>
<p>* **Sig** then finds himself surrounded by am anti-magic field.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** takes lightning damage in the Demi plane as **Tyche** calls forth a fog cloud while dropping darkness.</p>
<p>* At the same time the Demi-lich calls a dust cloud while **Roscoe** hits him with a *"Scorching Ray"*. Then Kujo does more fire damage.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** attacks with thunder damage.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** turns invisible and hides in the demi plane until we can get him out.</p>
<p>* **Sig** feels around for the skull and calls his spiritual weapon towards him to damage the Demi lich.</p>
<p>* Flesh golems attack **Farrok** and miss every attack.</p>
<p>* **Roscoe** avoids getting swallowed by the demi plane.</p>
<p>* **Conor** shouts "Turn off the fog!"</p>
<p>* **Tyche** does and **Conor** casts a spell at the Demi plane, it pops and **Farrok** and his friends all come out to greet us.</p>
<p>* **Conor** then casts unsettling words on the Demi lich.</p>
<p>* Demi lich howls and we all take damage.</p>
<p>* Field drops on **Sig**, he is magical again.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** falls and takes a death save.</p>
<p>* **Roscoe** and Kujo do more fire damage to the demi lich.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** uses his last charm of invisibility to move and heal **Tyche**.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** then goes down again.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** kills the Demi lich with a firebolt!</p>
<p>* **Roscoe** makes the skull able to heal us.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** takes advantage of it, then **Sig** heals us all a lot!</p>
<p>* **Conor** hypnotizes the enemies left.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** mind lances the golem.</p>
<p>* Then we all finish off the last enemies.</p>
<p>* We search the room</p>
<p>* Find the word to deactivate the shield, Saladganar</p>
<p>* Staff of poser!</p>
<p>* Spell book of Ithorus!</p>
