  <h2> 20211110 Session Notes </h2>
  
  
<p>* Start the session with a long rest in which **Farrok** has a dream of being on a beach.</p>
<p>* **Karla** is still banging on the shield with everything she has to try and get into the tower. She continues doing the same going from tower to tower.</p>
<p>* **Conor** says "You'll never forget your first time!" as **Farrok** describes a warm feeling, starts laughing, then grabs a broom and rides it around the room.</p>
<p>* We then discuss using the powerful scrolls in our possession to go after **Karla**, The Frostmaiden, or trying to stop the Rime at Mithilar.</p>
<p>* **Conor** looks at **Tyche** and tells her that she will die if she uses the fail-safe and breaks the staff as a "Nuke."</p>
<p>* **Sig** ask for *"Divine Intervention"*, but is denied.</p>
<p>* **Conor** suggests that we go outside and use the scroll to call the comet on **Karla**.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** pulls out another panther from her bag of tricks.</p>
<p>* **Conor** tells us about his ultimate plan of erasing his existence to defeat his mother, **Karla**, by going back in time and removing the conditions of his own birth.</p>
<p>* He then offers to loan a weapon to **Tyche**.</p>
<p>* **Oyea** says "I just want to kill that bitch!"</p>
<p>* After individually talking with **Conor** for a last "heart to heart" in case we all die, we start a CIA chant to pump up the energy for our last chance at stopping the Rime and **Karla**!</p>
<p>* **Sig** then asks his augury, and trusting in **Conor** is said to be will and woe.</p>
<p>* **Conor** then gets on the dragon with **Oyea**, and they fly off to the obelisk.</p>
<p>* The rest of us fly out to the Mithilar and see a huge crystal beneath an aura.</p>
<p>* We continue right through the aura towards a golden orb, and see the Frostmaiden!</p>
<p>* ***ROLL INITIATIVE!***</p>
<p>* **Farrok** attacks first with a spell, and fails.</p>
<p>* Frostmaiden flies up.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** moves up, produces a flame in his hand, and throws it at the Frostmaiden with a critical hit!</p>
<p>* **Sig** moves up, starts an aura, then attacks.</p>
<p>* **Roscoe** calls forth lightining, Frostmaiden is hurt enough to make a death save.</p>
<p>* Next **Kujo** spits a seed of flame on her.</p>
<p>* Frostmaiden teleports in front of **Tyche**, and **Tyche** *"Misty Steps"* away.</p>
<p>* Then her panther attacks the Roc that Frostmaiden flew in on, and **Tyche** is then open to attack Frostmaiden with an *"Eldritch Blast"* which is enough to shatter her current form.</p>
<p>* Frostmaiden then moves close to **Farrok** and most of us make a saving throw.</p>
<p>* Her Roc flies to **Tyche**, attacks and grapples her.</p>
<p>* Frostmaiden then pulls an icicle off of herself, throws it near **Throkken**, and an Ice Mefit appears.</p>
<p>* **Oyea** moves up and attacks the Frostmaiden.</p>
<p>* As **Farrok** tries to move away, Frostmaiden gets a nat 20 on her opp attack!</p>
<p>* However **Orikeo** is able to stop the crit with a Runic Shield.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** then attacks her with a killer of the phantasmal kind.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** then attacks the Ice Mefit with another flame produced in his hand, but misses. He then tries to ignite his Flame Tongue sword, but doesn't know the command word!</p>
<p>* **Sig** then calls out his spirit guardians and the Ice Mefit explodes from the damage.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** and **Sig** take shrapnel damage from the exploding Ice Mefit.</p>
<p>* **Roscoe** uses the Ice Mefit's death to make a healing flame for us.</p>
<p>* **Sig** takes full advantage of the healing flame.</p>
<p>* **Roscoe** then calls lightning on the Frostmaiden.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** *"Misty Steps"* and *"Mind Slivers"* the Roc.</p>
<p>* Frostmaiden looks at **Roscoe**, he is now incased in a block of ice, restrained.</p>
<p>* Her Roc swoops down on **Sig** and takes damage from the spirit guardians.</p>
<p>* However the Roc get to **Sig**, grapples him, restrains him, and then flies 60 feet up in the air with **Sig**.</p>
<p>* Frostmaiden legendary action, Frost Flurry, we all take damage.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** moves back, calls his spell book to be closer to the Frostmaiden and casts *"Bigsby's Hand"* from his book.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** moves to **Roscoe** and attacks the ice block, no damage.</p>
<p>* **Sig** does something.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** hits the Roc with a psychic lance while her panther attacks the Frostmaiden.</p>
<p>* The Frostmaiden recharges!</p>
<p>* **Farrok** is now also trapped in an ice block.</p>
<p>* Frostmaiden moves to **Roscoe**, attacks him and **Orikeo**.</p>
<p>* **Oyea** moves up and attacks the Frostmaiden.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** attacks and action surges to hit Frostmaiden as many times as possible.</p>
<p>* **Sig** attacks the Roc enough to incapacitate it, then flies closer to Frostmaiden and hits her with a guiding bolt.</p>
<p>* Frostmaiden legendary action and hits **Orikeo**.</p>
<p>* **Roscoe** rolls to get out of the ice block, fails.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** attacks the Frostmaiden.</p>
<p>* Frostmaiden attacks and hits **Orikeo**.</p>
<p>* Her Roc flies in to attack **Sig**.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** does something.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** turns into a Polar bear!</p>
<p>* **Roscoe** makes another roll to get out of the ice block.</p>
<p>* **Sig** attacks and hurts the Roc.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** directs and *"Eldritch Blast"* at the Roc.</p>
<p>* Frostmaiden again attacks and hits **Orikeo**.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo**, as a polar bear, jumps on the Frostmaiden to knock her over, but she stands tall.</p>
<p>* **Sig** then attacks by opening a book, tendrils comes out, grab and pull the Roc into the book!</p>
<p>* The scene is so terrifying even the Frostmaiden looks afraid of what happened to the Roc.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** attacks Frostmaiden.</p>
<p>* The Frostmaiden shatters!</p>
<p>* We see a tiny blue, icy globe, floating. Her last form!</p>
<p>* The Frostmaiden, as the tiny globe, flies up and shoots at **Orikeo**.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** takes a few saves.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** drops out of bear form, produces another flame and throws it at the ice block containing **Roscoe**.</p>
<p>* **Sig** drops down and heals most of us with a mass heal.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** *"Eldritch Blasts"* the tiny globe with thunder damage.</p>
<p>* Frostmaiden calls forth a blizzard and then she moves towards Mithilar.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** produces one more flame and finally breaks **Roscoe** out of the ice block!</p>
<p>* Then **Kujo** shoots a seed of flame at the Frostmaiden.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** moves and shoots Frostmaiden with *"Eldritch Blasts"* with a lot of damage.</p>
<p>* Frostmaiden *"Polar Rays"* at **Tyche** then moves away.</p>
<p>* **Farrok** is still locked in a block of ice.</p>
<p>* Frostmaiden takes a few saves.</p>
<p>* **Orikeo** moves to **Farrok** and gets him out of the block of ice with more produce flame.</p>
<p>* **Sig** moves down and heals **Farrok**.</p>
<p>* **Roscoe** calls forth a 7th level! Lightning on the Frostmaiden, and does a total of 13 damage.</p>
<p>* **Tyche** gets the kill shot on the Frostmaiden with an *"Eldritch Blast"*!</p>
<p>* **Sig** moves up and heals **Farrok**, and removes the curse he's under.</p>
<p>* **Roscoe** attempts to catch the essence of the Frostmaiden, a snowflake, in a jar.</p>
<p>* **Karla** is now walking up towards us, dragging **Conor's** bloody, dead body.</p>
<p>* She gets close, we attack, she counterspells and avoids **Orikeo's** Thunderwave.</p>
<p>* **Sig** grabs the snowflake essence of Frostmaiden, and shoves it into the Mithilar.</p>
<p>* **Conor** gets up and uses a scroll to summon a Tarrasque!</p>
<p>* We all run away as the Tarrasque and **Karla** fight.</p>
<p>* Finally making it to the obelisk, **Conor** jams the staff into the slot.</p>
<p>* An intense arcane pulse goes out, even **Karla** can feel it, but can't leave the Tarrasque to stop us!</p>
<p>* As **Karla** is moving and trying to dodge the Tarrasque attacks, **Conor** moves his hands like those of a clock.</p>
<p>* Everything stops!</p>
<p>* </p>
<p>* </p>
<p>* </p>
<p>* As we make our way out of Ythrin, **Karla**, a red Tiefling, who we picked up exploring the Ten Towns, expresses how exhausted she is after our final battle with the Frostmaiden.</p>
<p>* Continuing on our way, each of starts to feel like we have a "double memory" of our time spent here, in Ten Towns.</p>
<p>* We all remember killing the Chardalyn Dragon, with **Karla** by our side.</p>
<p>* We all remember ending the Frostmaiden, with **Karla** by our side.</p>
<p>* **Throkken** is back with us, and **Sig** is a Kobold.</p>
<p>* We never met the Hags.</p>
<p>* Looking back further in our memories, we feel a sense of a great loss, it starts to feel as if we lost a family member, but don't know which one.</p>
<p>* **Conor** did it! He stopped the Rime from ever happening and stopped his mother from ever becoming a Lich. At the cost of erasing his existence from the multiverse.</p>
<p>* </p>
<p>* End of "Rime of the Frostmaiden"</p>
