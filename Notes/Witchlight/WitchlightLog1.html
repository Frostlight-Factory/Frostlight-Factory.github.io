  <h2> 20211117 Session Notes </h2>
  
  
<p>** Katinka, Bellasar, and Vellia arrive at the carnival individually, and recognize each other while waiting in line to enter.</p>
<p>** Zayln walks up to the line, Kaylen notices he's missing an eye, without hesitation points it out and ask him about it.</p>
<p>** Upon reaching the ticket booth, the goblin attendant greets us, and hands us a box with tickets already purchased by an anonymous benefactor.</p>
<p>** However, to enter the carnival we have to don and continue to wear a pair of appropriately sized butterfly wings, which are also handed to us.</p>
<p>** As soon as she receives and puts on her wings, Vellia runs up to a monkey playing a calliope and starts to dance around with him.</p>
<p>** Katinka tries to convince the monkey to join us, however he's too busy, you know, doing his job.</p>
<p>** After wandering away from the monkey, a squirrel passing out dandilions comes up to us and hands us each one and tells us to blow it and make a wish! (A secret we each tell the DM)</p>
<p>** Next we come to the "high point" of the carnival, a BUbble Teapot Ride! It costs one ticket punch and we get to ride in bubbles and see the whole carnival from the air! They are tough to steer though.</p>
<p>** Since only a few of our party can control the bubbles, we end up in different parts of the carnival.</p>
<p>** Zayln, Bellasar, and Vellia all end up at the carousel of unicorns. Zayln and Vellia start talking to Diana, who is a Centaur working on the carousel. </p>
<p>** Katinka and Kaylen eventually make their way to us at the carousel.</p>
<p>** We find the door leading into the carousel's center, and find four riddles to solve. They appear to be names of unicorns on the carousel.</p>
<p>		Fortune, B _ _ _ _</p>
<p>		Fall, P _ _ _ _ _ _</p>
<p>		Stone, M _ _ _ _ _</p>
<p>		Stitch, N _ _ _ _</p>
<p>		{Bold, Pride, Moss, Nine}</p>
<p>** After we solve the riddle, the unicorns on the carousel start to move, and we get a free ride for fixing it!</p>
<p>** As we are enjoying the ride, the unicorns talk to us and inform each of us who has what we are each missing, and the benefactors of the carnival; The Hourglass Coven of Hags!</p>
<p>** We are each told which hag controls our curse, and what they are each allergic to.</p>
<p>** Barlona Blightstraw is allergic to seeing someone in "Widdershins."</p>
<p>** And we get a descriptions of the lair of the hags from the unicorns.</p>
<p>** We look over at Harvey, and he is grabbing randomly at the air. Apparently he is seeing "invisible floating fish" after smoking some grass with a carnie.</p>
<p>** Katinka pulls out and straps something on her arm.</p>
<p>** We all hear a weird, unsettling whisper, seemingly coming from Zayln, but his lips aren't moving.</p>
<p>** Kaylen pokes at the weird eyeball tattoo on Zayln's chest, it looks evil.</p>
<p>** Zayln then asks to see our weapons and see what kind of attacks we know.</p>
<p>** Harvey pulls out his rapier and engages in a little friendly sparring.</p>
<p>** Next Bellasar pulls out his scimitar and also engages in a little sparring.</p>
<p>** When Vellia is asked to show her weapon, she hold up an innocent looking staff and says "I'm not much of a fighter," then Zayln finds himself knocked on his ass mysteriously.</p>
<p>** Kaylen looks scared after Vellia laughs at the position in which Zayln finds himself. Then Kaylen too, finds himself knocked on his ass!</p>
<p>** Zayln screams at a group of kids to scare them. However he does a horrible performance and the kids laugh at him instead.</p>
<p>** Kaylen changes into something else, {pic on discord}, and we all make a wisdom save.</p>
<p>** End Session 1</p>
