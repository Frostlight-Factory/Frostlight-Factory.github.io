  <h2> 20211201 Session Notes </h2>
  
  
<p>** Kaylen changes into his true form, horns curved like a deer, fanged teeth, long greasy black hair, forked ears, his missing eye is back and whole, and most importantly gender ambiguous.</p>
<p>** His posture also changed to be more closed off and reserved, almost as if they are ashamed of their body.</p>
<p>** Hags took his humanity and through a ritual turned them into a Hexblood-Hag born person.</p>
<p>** We also learn of a large bounty of 10,000 G for "The Black Lotus" which happens to be the person in front of us due to the fact they held out their hand and a Black Lotus grew out from it.</p>
<p>** Katinka ate the lotus literally right out of their hand!</p>
<p>** Harvey asks for a lotus as well, Kaylen produces another and Harvey eats it.</p>
<p>** Zayln talks to Kaylen. And talks, and talks.</p>
<p>** Katinka holds out her hand, grows a lotus, and eats it.</p>
<p>** As we make our way to the Dragonfly ride, Zayln and Kaylen continue talking.</p>
<p>** Zayln presses too hard and Kaylen puts their hood up and tries to cover up while continuing with us.</p>
<p>** We see a large tree beckon us over to the entrance to the Dragonfly ride. We also see a little red squirrel on the tree that is very skeptical of our group.</p>
<p>** Vellia gets a ticket punch and enters the ride, followed by Harvey who just walks on as a staff perk.</p>
<p>** Zayln tries to stealth in by grabbing Harvey's tail, he's the complete opposite of stealthy, the tree and squirrel call him out, but let him go anyway.</p>
<p>** As everyone finishes getting on the ride, alarms start to go off, and we see a dwarf hanging from the outside of the ride about to fall!</p>
<p>** A few of the group members see a crow sneak off into the crowd as the rest of us try to figure out how to help the dwarf.</p>
<p>** Harvey, Zayln, Kaylen, and Belasuar all go after the crow while Vellia and Katinka get the dwarf down safely.</p>
<p>** Somehow Harvey is leading the party through the crowd even though he can't even find his own dick! SMH</p>
<p>** Zayln, Belasuar, and Harvey start a fight while "talking" the the crow.</p>
<p>** The crow blows a powder in Zayln's face and he almost falls unconscious.</p>
<p>** Katinka meanwhile is trying to negotiate with the tree for a free ride since we saved the dwarf from injury. She is denied because only the carnival owners can give out free rides apparently.</p>
<p>** Vellia and Katinka meet up with the rest of the group in a conflict with a crow.</p>
<p>** We find out the crow is really a Kenku, who's name is Kegglestream.</p>
<p>** Belasuar and Vellia are informed by their patron that the Kenku is Fey, and we should press on that issue.</p>
<p>** Zayln plays 20 questions with Kegglestream, but loses count after the 53rd question.</p>
<p>** We learn about the Kenku's patron, Zabrina, and how she used to run the carnival before Mr. Witch and Mr. Light. And she stopped communicating with her and she doesn't know why.</p>
<p>** She also makes voices like Mr. Witch and Mr. Light after overhearing their conversations.</p>
<p>** Harvey detects Kegglestream's thoughts while Kaylen places a hand on Zayln telling him to let Kegglestream go.</p>
<p>** We make a plan to meet Kegglestream in one hour in the Feasting Orchard.</p>
<p>** Vellia makes a small child illusion in front of Zayln.</p>
<p>** Next we head to the Gondola Swans, get our tickets punched, and get on.</p>
<p>** Fetherene is the name of the swan we are riding.</p>
<p>** We talk with her about "joy" and what she likes to do. She asks if we even exist.</p>
<p>** Kaylen makes a green flame in his hand and says he is a victim of time.</p>
<p>** Onward to the Feasting Orchard!</p>
<p>** We see Kegglestream eating at a table, and she motions us over.</p>
<p>** We all enter the eating contest, with a few bowing out early.</p>
<p>** Katinka won the contest, evan after all the "Custard damage."</p>
<p>** She won a huge cupcake as a reward, and ate it right away and turned invisible!</p>
<p>** Next we sit and talk to Kegglestream.</p>
<p>** As he sits down, Harvey gets a pie in the face from the invisible Katinka.</p>
<p>** Vellia sneaks under the table and ties Harvey's shoe laces together.</p>
<p>** DM rewind and insert Kaylen asking the gondola swan questions we totally forgot about at the time.</p>
<p>** As we talk to Kegglestream, a mysterious person is watching us.</p>
<p>** He starts to come over, playing his lute. He's a blue skin Tiefling, and is singing something none of us can understand.</p>
<p>** Katinka throws a pie at the Tiefling, but misses. And he says something about what each of us is missing, and he doesn't have a name on this plane...</p>
<p>** He pulls a ticket out of Zayln's pocket, shows us a mark on it, and says he's the one that bought them for us.</p>
<p>** Zayln grabs his face, says he can't take it any more. Then we all feel calmer.</p>
<p>** Belasuar's and Vellia's patron again communicates with them and says "Watch this one!" In reference to the blue Tiefling.</p>
<p>** We all look at each other, look back and the Tiefling was gone in the blink of an eye!</p>
<p>** We finally agree with Kegglestream to meet in the Big Top for the main show.</p>
<p>** As Harvey gets up, he falls on his face due to his laces being tied together.</p>
<p>** We get to the front row of the Big Top for the show, Zayln, Harvey, and Katinka all get up and perform.</p>
<p>** The crowd is energized from the performances.</p>
<p>** We see a Bugbear in the crowd, and he tells us to follow him.</p>
<p>** We go to meet Mr. Witch and Mr. Light in their trailer, with Thaco the Clown waiting outside.</p>
<p>** There is discussion of a "veiny thermometer" for a while. I believe it was naturally warm to the touch.</p>
<p>** Then we realize Mr. Light is holding a weather vein.</p>
<p>** They remember us from years ago, when we were kids. And they discuss Kegglestream with us.</p>
<p>** Upon leaving the meeting, someone else gets our attention and says we need to get Mr. Witch's watch to get leverage over them.</p>
<p>** We need to get the watch NOW since they are leaving and packing up soon.</p>
<p>** We discuss how to go about getting the watch.</p>
<p>** Kaylen shows off with a hawk and a magical jackal.</p>
<p>** Kaylen then asks Zayln about not murdering anyone to get the watch.</p>
<p>** We settle on turning Kaylen into a monkey and have Harvey make the monkey silent to steal the watch.</p>
<p>** Katinka picks up a rock, and makes it smell really bad!</p>
<p>** Kaylen, as a silent monkey holding a smelly rock, mimes to us that throwing the rock in the tent is Step #1, so what's Step #2?</p>
<p>** End Session 2</p>
