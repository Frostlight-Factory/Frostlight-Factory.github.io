  <h2> 20211208 Session Notes </h2>
  
  
<p>** Kaylen underwent a transformation since the last time we saw him, and he is now a Drakewarden.</p>
<p>** We see him pull out a little figurine, then in a deep voice says "CRE DOV OUST!" and his red wyrmling, the size of a dog or jackal, appears by his side.</p>
<p>** Kaylen then introduces Zakari as he informs us of his backstory of raising Wyrms back home. And this one took a particular liking to him.</p>
<p>** Zaylen tries to talk to Zakari, and he hides in Kaylen's coat. Zaylen offers some rations and Zakari eats them.</p>
<p>** To recall, we need a distraction to get Mr. Witch and Mr. Light apart so we can steal the pocket watch.</p>
<p>** Zaylen brings up asking Kettlestream for help because of how sneaky she is.</p>
<p>** We also discuss our previous plan of throwing stinky rocks in their tent, and nabbing the watch when they run out.</p>
<p>** We also recall that Mr. Witch and Mr. Light are [Shadar-kai](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shadar-kai), from the Shadowfell. </p>
<p>** While discussion of the plan continues, Katinka makes a magical box for Harvey.</p>
<p>** Next we head back to the Feasting Orchard to find Kettlestream and ask for her help.</p>
<p>** While talking to Kettlestream, one of us notices a large, inconspicuous Bugbear watching us.</p>
<p>** It is also noted that his shirt has symbols of the [Kryn Dynasty](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Kryn_Dynasty)</p>
<p>** Then, as per usual, Zaylen started bugging the Bugbear!</p>
<p>** Kaylen then approached and started to converse with the Bugbear. After a very short conversation, he came back to us and said we shouldn't talk to the Bugbear ever again. No particular reason, just don't talk to him.</p>
<p>** Meanwhile, Harvey and Katinka are continuing to discuss a plan involving Kettlestream.</p>
<p>** {{Side discussion of the definition of [Dodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecahedron)}}</p>
<p>** Then Kettlestream approaches us.</p>
<p>** While Kettlestream is with us the Bugbear is keeping a close eye on her.</p>
<p>** Bellesar notices the Bugbear watching Kettlestream, and tells us.</p>
<p>** Zaylen then says to the Bugbear "Smirnoff, what's your problem?"</p>
<p>** To which the Bugbear says nothing.</p>
<p>** We are then informed by Kettlestream that the Bugbear is a bounty hunter.</p>
<p>** Harvey - "Well, it's time to hit the ole' dusty trail."</p>
<p>** We all try to get up and leave stealthily, without "Smirnoff" noticing.</p>
<p>** MAP CHANGE!</p>
<p>** Outside, making our way away from the tavern, Smirnoff stops us.</p>
<p>** Bellesar starts to walk away nonchalantly.</p>
<p>** Kaylen moves up to hide and summon Zakari. Then he casts "Zephyr Strike" on himself as Zakari climbs up "Smirnoff's" leg to bite him.</p>
<p>** Harvey then moves up and tries to magically hold "Smirnoff" from moving, and is successful along with paralyzing "Smirnoff"!</p>
<p>** Zaylen then moves up behind "Smirnoff" and critically hits with his trident.</p>
<p>** Katinka then moves into the trees for cover, shoots a crossbow followed by a wrist cannon at "Smirnoff".</p>
<p>** "Smirnoff" then attacks his closest target.</p>
<p>** Vellia hops into the trees to hide.</p>
<p>** Bellesar then "Tolls the Dead" and calls out his spiritual weapon near "Smirnoff".</p>
<p>** Kaylen moves up to attack and command Zakari to attack as well.</p>
<p>** Harvey then hits "Smirnoff" with his rapier and uses his rabbit legs to hop out of melee range.</p>
<p>** Zaylen attacks and misses, completely. Like he shouldn't have even tried to attack.</p>
<p>** Katinka moves into a tree, reloads her crossbow with some glowing ammunition, it and her wrist cannon both hit and do damage to "Smirnoff".</p>
<p>** "Smirnoff" then turns part skeletal, throws a dagger and hits Kettlestream, and immediately teleports to Kettlestream.</p>
<p>** "Smirnoff" grabs his dagger and pulls it out of Kettlestream, then as she is impaled on his blade, he lifts her off the ground, casts Eldritch Smite.</p>
<p>** Kettlestream's body explodes in a bloody mess, with nothing left but her head, hanging by her hair in "Smirnoff's" hand.</p>
<p>** As "Smirnoff" is attaching Kettlestream's head to his belt, Vellia creates an illusion of fluttering butterflies around his head.</p>
<p>** Bellesar moves.</p>
<p>** Kaylen moves up behind "Smirnoff" and stabs him. When he pulls his blade out, there is no blood.</p>
<p>** Harvey then tries to unsettle "Smirnoff" with a word by calling him a monster. To which "Smirnoff" is not unsettled.</p>
<p>** Zaylen attacks, misses, then moves away.</p>
<p>** Katinka shoots her crossbow and wrist cannon again.</p>
<p>** After getting shot again, "Smirnoff" looks directly at Katinka and tries to imprison her mentally.</p>
<p>** Katinka isn't strong enough to resist, she falls unconscious.</p>
<p>** "Smirnoff" then turns to Kaylen and says "You can come with me or we can keep going."</p>
<p>** Vellia moves up, tries to tie "Smirnoff's" shoes together, then uses her rabbit legs to hop away to safety.</p>
<p>** Bellesar heals with a powerful word, and Katinka is able to get back up.</p>
<p>** Kaylen and Zakari attack "Smirnoff".</p>
<p>** Harvey runs up to Katinka.</p>
<p>** Zaylen moves up to attack, and misses, again. Are you surprised? I'm not.</p>
<p>** Katinka gets up, uses her wings to fly up.</p>
<p>** "Smirnoff" attacks and brings Kaylen down to his knee with a strong blow.</p>
<p>** Katinka tries to persuade "Smirnoff" to not kill Kaylen while Vellia tries to calm his emotions.</p>
<p>** Zaylen keeps talking and provoking "Smirnoff".</p>
<p>** Vellia moves up again, throws sand in "Smirnoff's" face, and again bunny hops away.</p>
<p>** Bellesar misses "Smirnoff" with a guided bolt, however his spiritual weapon gets a critical hit!</p>
<p>** Kaylen, under the effects of a powerful, painful, word commands Zakari to get away. And Zakari makes his way to Harvey.</p>
<p>** Harvey then uses some words that are unsettling to "Smirnoff".</p>
<p>** Zaylen, Zaylen, Zaylen. Why do you even try? Is the trident too big for you to handle? You keep missing. And this time you even get hit when you back away from "Smirnoff", lol.</p>
<p>** Katinka then moves to get a bead on "Smirnoff", misses with her crossbow, but hits with her wrist cannon before flying out of his range.</p>
<p>** "Smirnoff" moves back, and casts a drakness that covers all of us, and we all go down to 0 hp!</p>
<p>** The "Maddening Darkness" got us!</p>
<p>** A mysterious, robbed, person appears.</p>
<p>** "Mass Cure Wounds" - 26 hp to everyone!</p>
<p>** We hear him singing a song, but it all sounds like gibberish to us, like he's singing in another language.</p>
<p>** "Smirnoff" attacks the mysterious person, knocks him out of the tree, and the mysterious person then stops time for "Smirnoff".</p>
<p>** Bellesar attacks and misses his and his spiritual weapon's attack.</p>
<p>** Kaylen and Zakari attack.</p>
<p>** Harvey moves up and inspires Kaylen in a way only a Bard could.</p>
<p>** Zaylen gets up, throws his trident at "Smirnoff", and finally, with the help from the Gods, hits! But it's only a scratch that's easily brushed off, like a mosquito bite.</p>
<p>** Katinka get up, shoots "Smirnoff" with her crossbow and wrist cannon.</p>
<p>** We notice the dagger that "Smirnoff" is in the process of throwing is slowly moving and cutting through the stopped time!</p>
<p>** It cuts through, hits a tree, and "Smirnoff" is instantly teleported to it, however he is still frozen as if stuck in time.</p>
<p>** Vellia moves up, grabs his dagger out of the tree, and hops away while taking some mental damage from touching the dagger.</p>
<p>** Bellesar hits "Smirnoff" with a guided bolt.</p>
<p>** Kaylen and Zakari move up and attack "Smirnoff".</p>
<p>** Harvey then inspires Vellia in a way that only a Bard could.</p>
<p>** Zaylen, if we got a level for every time you missed an attack, we'd be 20 after the second session. lmao</p>
<p>** Katinka shoots again, and kills "Smirnoff"!</p>
<p>** His body explodes, everyone within 30 ft takes necrotic damage from him exploding. Then he teleports away.</p>
<p>** As soon as Kaylen dropped to 0 hp, Zakari turned into a stone statue.</p>
<p>** Vellia death save.</p>
<p>** Bellesar death save.</p>
<p>** Kaylen death save.</p>
<p>** Harvey death save.</p>
<p>** Zaylen death save.</p>
<p>** Katinka, who was out of the explosion range, shoots "Smirnoff" again with her wrist cannon, he goes down but doesn't stay down as we learn he is undead!</p>
<p>** Vellia death save.</p>
<p>** Bellesar gets up, moves to "Smirnoff" and attacks, "Smirnoff" is now unconscious again.</p>
<p>** Kaylen death save.</p>
<p>** Harvey death save.</p>
<p>** Zaylen death save.</p>
<p>** Katinka moves up to the group on the ground, making death saves.</p>
<p>** "Smirnoff" gets up, clicks a pen topper, and disappears.</p>
<p>** Katinka is able to give us all enough hp to get up.</p>
<p>** Harvey then gives Vellia and Zaylen more hp since they still are the most injured.</p>
<p>** Katinka starts talking to us as it begins to rain.</p>
<p>** We notice that Kaylen is still on the ground, upon closer inspection he is dead!</p>
<p>** Being close to the carnival, a crowd quickly starts to form around us with Mr. Witch and Mr. Light looking on as well.</p>
<p>** Vellia tries to pickpocket the watch they need, and is caught, red handed!</p>
<p>** Zaylen convinces him to give us the watch, and he does.</p>
<p>** DING! LEVEL UP!</p>
<p>** Bellesar talks about keeping Kaylen's body in Harvey's bed. To which Harvey asks if there is literally anywhere to keep his body? </p>
<p>** We end up deciding to take his body to Zadash in the morning.</p>
<p>** In the middle of the night we hear a knock on our door.</p>
<p>** We see another mysterious figure. This time he looks like a human in his mid 40's, thick dark hair, wearing a green robe with gold filigree.</p>
<p>** "I believe you have my apprentice here."</p>
<p>** END SESSION!</p>

<p>** Side note: somewhere along the way we learned the name of the Bugbear is "Burly," and he is an assistant to Mr. Witch and Mr. Light.</p>
