  <h2> 20220302 Session Notes </h2>
  
  
<p>** We notice two others with the guy asking about his apprentice. One a young male with light green skin which makes him look like he's always sick is introduced as Bo'Az. And the other introduces himself as Quinn.</p>
<p>** After introductions between our group and the mysterious figures companions, he drops his disguise and we see snake like features, and discover he's originally from the southern islands.</p>
<p>** Bellesar asks him for a pin prick of blood for his faith.</p>
<p>** With haste after the introductions, he picks up Kaylen's body and heads straight for the biggest, tallest tree in the center of town.</p>
<p>** While following him, we see some town guards run off, and others follow along with us and the mass of townspeople that have joined us.</p>
<p>** Getting closer to the tree, some guards come out from between buildings to block passage, and arrest the "Black Lotus!"</p>
<p>** After negotiating passage to the tree, the Black Lotus puts Kaylen's body down, touching the tree.</p>
<p>** Then we see serpents come out of his robe and coil down his arms before digging their fangs into him!</p>
<p>** As this is happening, we also see the tree pulsing with a light that gets brighter with every pulse.</p>
<p>** Finally it culminates in a flash so bright everyone thinks they're blind at first, however they all soon recover their normal sight.</p>
<p>** We see Kaylen's body moving, he's breathing again!</p>
<p>** As we look up at the tree now, the blossoms are all pure white.</p>
<p>** After the commotion of the procession of the Black Lotus through the town streets, and the bright flash of light that seemingly brought someone back to life, he and Kaylen disappear in a flash in front of the entire crowd that has gathered.</p>
<p>** As we were the closest to the Black Lotus, we are quickly cornered and questioned by the guards.</p>
<p>** Harvey convincingly tells them we are with the carnival and just joined the march to see what was happening. We are not in any way associated with the hooded guy, nor have we been, nor will we ever be in the future. Thanks for doing a great job as guards. Now we are headed back to the carnival. Bye.</p>
<p>** Once we make it back to the carnival, our moods are immediately lifted and we again feel happy and joyful.</p>
<p>** Vellia and her patron have a little telepathic chat about what just happened with the Black Lotus, and then he makes Zaylen fall over for Vellia's amusement.</p>
<p>** We talk to Burly before approaching Mr. Witch and Mr. Light and he tells us they are in a mood.</p>
<p>** They discuss the ending of the carnival and them moving on. We probe about the hags involvement, and are met with non-answers.</p>
<p>** They also bring up the ceremony for crowning the princess of the carnival, and let us figure out who it is.</p>
<p>** Bo'Az opens up a gift box, and gets a cream pie in the face!</p>
<p>** On the bottom of the pie pan is a name, Vellia! Vellia is crowned the princess of the carnival!</p>
<p>** She's so happy she can't stop hopping around and laughing.</p>
<p>** They all march to the big top for the crowning ceremony, and the crowd is full.</p>
<p>** Vellia sits on a platform in the middle of the stage, with Mr. Witch and Mr. Light on wither side.</p>
<p>** A beautifully wrapped box appears and opens up. Butterflies fly out and a resplendent crown appears, that just happens to be Vellia's size.</p>
<p>** She gets crowned and then flies around the carnival on the back of a Displacer Beast!</p>
<p>** After the ride, she is knighted with a "weather vein" (wink, wink), and receives a special charm with magical properties that are written on the character sheet.</p>
<p>** The conclusion of the ceremony has us learning about Tasha and how close her cabin happens to be to our current location.</p>
<p>** Naturally we decided to go find this cabin. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>** On our way, Vellia and a few of the others start laughing uncontrollably and fall to the ground for a little while.</p>
<p>** Shortly after that, we find ourselves in what seems like a hall of mirrors and a curtain shuts behind us, unable to be opened.</p>
<p>** Mirrors start to move around and we find everyone has been separated from each other. But we can still hear each other.</p>
<p>** We all try to make our way to the middle of the moving mirrors, and are individually confronted by dark whispers and thoughts.</p>
<p>** Some of our group can't mentally hold off the dark thoughts and fall to their knees, crying.</p>
<p>** Eventually we all make it to the center, and while discussing what happened to each of us, a Bugbear approaches with a few companions.</p>
<p>** ROLL INIATIVE!</p>
<p>** Quinn moves up, misses a punch on the Bugbear, but is successful in grappling him.</p>
<p>** Evil Gunslinger 1 shoots and misses.</p>
<p>** Zaylen puts a Hex on the Bugbear, then misses an attack.</p>
<p>** Kaylen moves up and hits the Bugbear hard!</p>
<p>** Evil Gunslinger 2 attacks and misses.</p>
<p>** Quinn attacks the Bugbear and hits, hard!</p>
<p>** Ragnar moves up and attacks the Bugbear.</p>
<p>** Bo'Az twins a "Mindwhip" at the Gunslingers.</p>
<p>** Bellesar attacks Evil Gunslinger 2.</p>
<p>** Vellia attacks the same Gunslinger and misses.</p>
<p>** Quinn keeps attacking the Bugbear with powerful punches.</p>
<p>** Evil Gunslinger 1 shoots at Ragnar and misses.</p>
<p>** Zaylen attacks the Bugbear with his trident.</p>
<p>** Harvey mocks the Bugbear in a vicious manner.</p>
<p>** Evil Gunslinger 2 attacks Ragnar and hits.</p>
<p>** Ragnar attacks the Bugbear and hits.</p>
<p>** Bo'Az uses missiles that are magic and kills Evil Gunslinger 2.</p>
<p>** Bellesar uses his spiritual weapon on Evil Gunslinger 1.</p>
<p>** Vellia attacks and misses Evil Gunslinger 1.</p>
<p>** Quinn attacks and misses Evil Gunslinger 1.</p>
<p>** Harvey then inspires Vellia in a way that only a Bard could.</p>
<p>** Zaylen moves up and attacks the Bugbear.</p>
<p>** Ragnar attacks and gets the knockout blow on the Bugbear.</p>
<p>** Quinn attacks the last Gunslinger and rips him in half!</p>
<p>** We tie the Bugbear to a post, and wait for him to wake up.</p>
<p>** He is thoroughly interrogated.</p>
<p>** Bo'Az pats his down and takes his gold and a pistol.</p>
<p>** Vellia pulls out a gnarly, jagged, hooked dagger just to intimidate the Bugbear. However she lunges at him and stabs him in the neck immediately killing him.</p>
<p>** The Bugbear then "melts" into a pool of black liquid and then slips away under the edge of the tent.</p>
<p>** Harvey then questions Vellia about killing the Bugbear instead of talking to him. Vellia replies that she had to kill him.</p>
<p>** Mr. Witch and Mr. Light talk to us about what transpired, and then as they walk in to the hall of mirrors we hear them saying a rhyme.</p>
<p>** "Hither, tither, here and there. Wander, yonder, show me where."</p>
<p>** As we each enter the hall of mirrors, we recite the same rhyme.</p>
<p>** WELCOME TO THE FEY WILD!</p>
<p>** END SESSION!</p>
