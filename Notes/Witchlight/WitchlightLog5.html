  <h2> 20220309 Session Notes </h2>
  
  

<p>** Start the session with reviewing character backstories, including motivations, and something that each of them has lost that they are trying to find.</p>
<p>** Next the DM summarized the last session to remind us of what happened, and where we are starting for this session.</p>
<p>** We are also re-informed of a quote we heard and should probably remember "By the rule of three, Future, Present, Past, find the alicorn and release the dormant Queen."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>** We find ourselves standing on a tall causeway, under a hazy twilight sky, overlooking a fog covered swamp. In the distance we see glimpses through the fog of a learning tower, what appears to be a town, and a large hill.</p>
<p>** Vellia tries to communicate with her patron for information and advice, however he has never been to this part of the Feywild, and he has no desire to step back in the Feywild.</p>
<p>** Ragnar sits down and concentrates for a little bit, then stands up and says "Ok, I now have a lay of the land."</p>
<p>** To which he is met with a few questions from some of the party members, and he responds about having an innate ability.</p>
<p>** After the fighting and traveling to another plane, the Feywild, the group decides it would be best to take a long rest before continuing further.</p>
<p>** While getting comfortable for a good sleep, both Vellia and Zaylen feel something pulling at their spirits. Almost like something they lost is calling out to them from this area of the Feywild.</p>
<p>** Zaylen mentions this to the group, and a few others talk about what they have lost and are looiing for as well.</p>
<p>** Everyone lost something that greatly affects them mentally, physically, or emotionally, except Zaylen. He lost a teddy bear he likes to hold while he sucks his thumb...</p>
<p>** During the long rest on the causeway, Kaylen and Bellesar assume the first watch. And Harvey, Bo'Az, and Ragnar on the last watch.</p>
<p>** Ragnar asks Harvery where he's from, Harvey replies from the coast. Then Ragnar says he's familiar with the coast, did he come from Nicodemus? Harvey says "Nigowho?"</p>
<p>** Upon waking for the day, we discuss what we know about the area, and which direction we plan to start adventuring.</p>
<p>** We recall the locations of the three (3) hag lairs, and what is a weakness for each of them.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p style="background-color: PowderBlue">- Eldest sister Skabatha, also known as Granny Nightshade, is a recluse who lives mostly in the past. Her dwelling is in an ancient forest. She passes the time by making toys for children and is part toy herself. Woe betides adventurers if the wind-up key sticking out of her back runs down.
<p style="background-color: PowderBlue">- Skabatha can't remember the first person she sees in the morning.</p>

<p style="background-color: PowderBlue">- Bavlorna Blightstraw, also known as Slack-jawed Lorna, is a toad-like hag who embodies the present. She can create miniature manifestations of herself, which run around her and perform odd tasks. She exists in the here and now and doesn’t dwell on the past or pay much mind to the future. She lives in the swamp settlement of Downfall, among a court of bullywugs.</p>
<p style="background-color: PowderBlue">- Bavlorna Blightstraw is allergic to seeing someone in "widdershins."</p>

<p style="background-color: PowderBlue">- The third hag is Endelyn Moongrave, also known as Bitter End (“I adore her art,” Chris says, “and hers is a fascinating story”). Endelyn is a prognosticator who can see the future. She lives in a mountaintop theater, where she has plays performed for her amusement. But she also wears a dress that can double as a theater contraption so she can perform plays telling the future of those she meets.</p>
<p style="background-color: PowderBlue">- Endelyn Moongrave has forseen her death during an eclipse.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>** While discussing the day's plan, Bo'Az and Harvey notice Ragnar and Kaylen are missing! And there are claw marks and blood on the ground where they were sleeping.</p>
<p>** Bellesar uses his Chanel Divinity to locate Ragnar, and he locates him in a bad state. 0 hp, unconscious, paralyzed, poisoned, and restrained.</p>
<p>** Zaylen runs, jumps off the causeway, then walks back up the side saying to us "Let's go!"</p>
<p>** Due to the 100 foot drop from where we are to the ground, we discuss how to get everyone down safely. </p>
<p>** Zaylen takes Vellia down, and the rest use a few ropes to climb down.</p>
<p>** Once we are all down and ready to continue, we hear singing, and it's getting lounder as we stand here.</p>
<p>** Then we see six (6) Harengons, with a few of them riding snails, singing as they dance-march through the swamp like a Disney movie.</p>
<p>** Agnar Longcock appears out of nowhere!</p>
<p>** Zaylen runs towards the Harengons that were singing, they get aggressive and pull swords out!</p>
<p>** ROLL INIATIVE!</p>
<p>** Zaylen immediately casts "Shatter," and it gets the first four (4) Harengon's that are close together.</p>
<p>** Right after the "Shatter" went off, all the Harengons said "Fuck this!" and started to run away. </p>
<p>** Quinn moved up, threw a dagger, and killed one!</p>
<p>** The Harengon Snipers move back and tell the others to get out of here.</p>
<p>** Vellia shoots a "Firebolt" and kills another one!</p>
<p>** Bo'Az moved up and killed two (2) more with magical missiles.</p>
<p>** Zaylen then yelled out "I just want to talk."</p>
<p>** To which the Harengons replied "Fuck you!" and they kept running away.</p>
<p>** Zaylen moved up, shot an "Eldritch Blast", and missed.</p>
<p>** Quinn moves up, his tattoos glow and he transforms into an enraged form! Then he throws a dagger, but misses.</p>
<p>** Vellia moves up a little more and misses a "Firebolt."</p>
<p>** Bo'Az moves up and also misses a "Firebolt."</p>
<p>** Zaylen kills another one with an "Eldritch Blast" to the neck!</p>
<p>** Harvey killed the last one so brutally, you would have nightmares if you read about his actions.</p>
<p>** After all of the Harengons are killed, Vellia moves to a snail, charms it, and rides it like the other Harengons were before the battle.</p>
<p>** Quinn moves to the other snail, tries to charm it as well but ends up scaring it instead.</p>
<p>** Bo'Az searches the bodies and finds some gold and a couple of crossbows. We each get 3 gold, Harvey and Vellia get the crossbows.</p>
<p>** Bo'Az then calms and rides the second snail that was scared by Quinn a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>** As we continue down what seems like a path, some of us perceive rustling in the bushes behind us, and it's getting closer. </p>
<p>** Then we see some red-skinned humanoids walk past us as they are looking down and picking up eggs.</p>
<p>** Harvey picks up an egg, they ask him for it, and after some comical gesturing he hands it over to them.</p>
<p>** Zaylen proceeds to ask them some non-sensical questions, and talk in riddles even he doesn't understand.</p>
<p>** Continuing on, we come to a stream. Zaylen is the first to kneel and put his head under water, and is promptly run over by Vellia, laughing her ass off, on a snail.</p>
<p>** He then gets out of the stream, and puts his head back under water with a few others and they all see some kind of visions.</p>
<p>** Zaylen also sees a toad, picks it up, inspects it closely, and discovers it's a toad.</p>
<p>** After a while further down the path, we come to a crumbling tower, and see someone calling out to us, hanging from a basket in the trees near the tower.</p>
<p>** Upon closer inspection, to get him down all we need to do is break the rope holding the basket.</p>
<p>** Vellia immediately, without hesitation, shoots a "Firebolt" to break the rope to get him down. And we hear him yell out as he falls "FFFFFFUUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKK!!!!!!"</p>
<p>** The basket hits the swamp floor, we see two (2) large serpentine creatures head directly for him.</p>
<p>** ROLL INIATIVE!</p>
<p>** After they attack the defenseless guy from the basket, and kill him, they turn towards our group.</p>
<p>** Harvey starts out mocking one of the snake creatures.</p>
<p>** Both snakes then move closer to our group.</p>
<p>** Bo'Az aims a "Mindwhip" at one.</p>
<p>** Vellia crits on a "Firebolt" attack!</p>
<p>** Quinn then moves up and grapples one of the snake creatures.</p>
<p>** Zaylen shoots an "Eldritch Blast," misses, and takes an attack of opportunity from one of the snakes as he moves back.</p>
<p>** During the "op attack" Zaylen is grappled by the snake and can't move!</p>
<p>** Harvey moves up to help free Zaylen from the snake's grasp.</p>
<p>** One of the snakes attacks Quinn and misses. The other attacks Zaylen but misses since he's grappled to tightly.</p>
<p>** Bo'Az hits the snake holding Zaylen with a few "Magic Missiles."</p>
<p>** Vellia hits the snake attacking Quinn with a "Firebolt."</p>
<p>** Quinn attacks the snake he's grappling and hits it right in the face!</p>
<p>** Zaylen tries to get out of the grapple with his trident, but misses.</p>
<p>** Harvey also misses the snake holding Zaylen with his rapier.</p>
<p>** The snake holding Zaylen hits him. The other snake breaks out of Quinn's grapple, and moves towards Bo'Az, while taking an op attack from Quinn.</p>
<p>** The snake is successful in attacking and grappling Bo'Az.</p>
<p>** Bo'Az struggles to get out of the snake's grasp, gets frustrated and shoots a "Firebolt" at it's head which kills it!</p>
<p>** Then continuing the momentum, he shoots a crossbow at the other snake and crits!</p>
<p>** Seeing the awesome crossbow shot, Vellia pulls out her new crossbow, shoots, and hits the snake still holding Zaylen.</p>
<p>** Quinn moves up to the remaining snake, snaps it's neck.</p>
<p>** Seeing Zaylen so bloody, Harvey sends a few heals his way.</p>
<p>** Bo'Az searches the bodies, and on the guy from the basket he finds 5 gold and a letter. The letter says "Please don't take my 5 gold."</p>
<p>** Continuing on, we come across a tiny creature, trapped in a magical cage.</p>
<p>** Zaylen again asks questions that have nothing to do with the current events or activities which are taking place. I'm starting to think he's just drunk all the time.</p>
<p>** Upon others talking to the creature, we learn about a Goblin named Jingle Jangle that has a key we need to open the cage.</p>
<p>** We decide it's best for the caged creature to come with us, so we bring him along to keep him safe while we find the key.</p>
<p>** Continuing on, we come to a bog with skeletons strewn about from a large battle, and two (2) suits of Elven armor are locked in combat.</p>
<p>** Zaylen yells out to greet them, they wave back. He then asks the closer one for a little friendly combat. The armor shakes it's helmet in agreement. They square up and get ready to fight, Zaylen pulls out a large weapon and crushes the armor in one blow!</p>
<p>** The other suit of armor springs into action against Zaylen to avenge it's partner's untimely demise</p>
<p>** Quinn crushes the other suit of armor, and all that is left recoverable from either set is one helmet.</p>
<p>** Traveling across a large hill, we see three (3) very tall trees moving toward us.</p>
<p>** Vellia talks to them about Jingle Jangle, and we find her location. Others talk to the trees too and get more information.</p>
<p>** Zaylen immediately talks about killing Jingle Jangle, unprovoked. I didn't know drunk Tritons were this blood thirsty.</p>
<p>** Finding Jingle Jangle's residence on the hill, among the tall trees, we talk to her and convince her to open the cage.</p>
<p>** As a reward, we get his sword, which is like a tiny dagger to us since he's a tiny creature.</p>
<p>** We talk to Jingle Jangle for a while, find out the origin of her name, her goals, her passions, etc. "keys, Keys, KEYS!"</p>
<p>** We also learn about the Briggands, their location, and them attacking anyone they can, including our new friend Jingle Jangle.</p>
<p>** As we leave Jingle Jangle and the hill, one of the trees we initially met gives us a key as we depart.</p>
<p>** The session ends with us heading towards our next proposed destination, Zaylen has a nightmare while riding on the snail behind Vellia. He ends up vomiting all over her! What a fucking, disgusting asshole!</p>  
<p>** END SESSION!</p>
