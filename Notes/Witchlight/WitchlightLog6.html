  <h2> 20220316 Session Notes </h2>
  
  
<hr></hr>
<p>**  <b>Additions to last session:</b></p>
<p>**  We got a creepy vibe off <span style="color: Yellow"> Jingle Jangle.</span></p>
<p>**  The <span style="color: Red">Harengons</span> were singing about <span style="color: Red">Agnar Longcock</span>, he was not actually with them.</p>

<hr></hr>
<p>**  We are heading towards Downfall via the Briggands Tollway.</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: Yellow">Quinn</span> starts talking to <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> about him getting sick all of a sudden, and the creepy eye in his chest is starring directly at <span style="color: Yellow">Quinn</span>.</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> kept talking about a great leviathan, and some other random shit.</p>
<p>**  We did learn that the teddy bear he lost is a memory of his mother, but that's just weak emotional, cry me a river, type shit.</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: Yellow">Quinn</span> lets it be known he thinks <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> is creepy.</p>
<p>**  We all unanimously agree.</p>
<p>**  While traveling, we come to a small camp for one (1). And in the ashes of the fire pit we find a partially burned book.</p>
<p>**  From what's left of it, we decipher the author is looking for a shot at <span style="color: Red">Agnar</span> and to find a shipment of guns, which shouldn't be here in the Feywild.</p>
<p>**  We arrive at the tollway, and it's full of plywood structures, in shit shape, above the high tide.</p>
<p>**  About 300 ft away, where the plywood structures converge, we see a very large tree stump.</p>
<p>**  To get through, we come up with a plan to sell the snails we acquired to the Briggands.</p>
<p>**  While discussing the plan, a mysterious <span style="color: Red">hooded figure</span> joins us on the wooden walkway.</p>
<p>**  We each hear a whisper in our head <span style="color: Red"><i>Agdon Longscarf</i></span>.</p>
<p>**  As we continue down the walkway towards the stump, we see two (2) skiffs full of <span style="color: Red">Harengon</span> appear out of the fog!</p>
<p>**  <b>ROLL INIATIVE!</b></p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> starts with a missed <span style="color: Magenta">"Eldritch Blast"</span> attack, because <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span>. Then tries to bite the <span style="color: Red">hooded figure</span> near us. <i>le sigh...</i></p>
<p>**  We hear a small explosion in the distance, then one of the <span style="color: Red">Harengon Briggands</span> with a gun dies from an impact to the head!</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Bellesar</span> says "WELL FUCK ME!"And casts <span style="color: Magenta">"Toll the Dead"</span> on the <span style="color: Red">hooded figure</span> followed up by casting his <span style="color: Magenta">"Spiritual Weapon"</span> to attack the <span style="color: Red">hooded figure</span> as well.</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Bo'Az</span> and <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> then take turns attacking the <span style="color: Red">hooded figure</span> before <span style="color: Yellow">Quinn</span> uses a glowing Rune and then grapples the <span style="color: Red">hooded figure</span>.</p>
<p>**  We see the <span style="color: Red">hooded figure</span> whip a branding iron around and brand <span style="color: Yellow">Quinn</span> on the side of the face!</p>
<p>**  After some yelling from searing pain, <span style="color: Yellow">Quinn</span> says he can't see the figure anymore! We tell him to keep holding on to him and not let go.</p>
<p>**  While blinded we see the <span style="color: Red">hooded figure</span> grab something from <span style="color: Yellow">Quinn</span>.</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Harvey</span> then runs up and stabs the <span style="color: Red">hooded figure</span>.</p>
<p>**  Next <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> gets hit by a sniper, lol.</p>
<p>**  The <span style="color: Red">briggands</span> surround <span style="color: LightGreen">Bellesar</span>, and he gets gang-banged with a few club attacks.</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: Yellow">Quinn</span> tries to punch the <span style="color: Red">hooded figure</span> in the face, still unable to see him, and hits dead on!</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> then casts <span style="color: Magenta">"Shatter"</span> to get the <span style="color: Red">briggands</span> off of <span style="color: LightGreen">Bellesar</span>. Then misses another bite.</p>
<p>**  We hear another small explosion, and one of the boats rocks from the impact.</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Bellesar</span> then puts the <span style="color: Red">briggands</span> around him to <span style="color: Magenta">"Sleep."</span></p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Bo'Az</span> hits the last sniper <span style="color: Red">briggand</span> with <span style="color: Magenta">"Magic Missile."</span></p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> finishes off the sniper with a <span style="color: Magenta">"Firebolt."</span></p>
<p>**  The <span style="color: Red">hooded figure</span> gets away from <span style="color: Yellow">Quinn</span> by hopping like a bunny, tries to brand <span style="color: LightGreen">Bellesar</span> but misses, then hops into the water to swim away.</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Harvey</span> shoots a crossbow at the <span style="color: Red">hooded figure</span> underwater, and the water makes the shot miss. Then he inspires <span style="color: Yellow">Quinn</span> the way that Bards can.</p>
<p>**  A missed shot by the Harengon sniper.</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: Yellow">Quinn</span> then runs and jumps in the water after the <span style="color: Red">hooded figure</span>.</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> gets a little too excited for water combat, his gills and fins start to jiggle, a white creamy substance appears from his pores, then he jumps in the water, throws his spear, and misses his target.</p>
<p>**  We hear yet another small explosion in the distance, and one of the sleeping <span style="color: Red">briggands</span> gets hit in the head and dies immediately.</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Bellesar</span> stabs one of the sleeping <span style="color: Red">briggands</span> in the head with a dagger.</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Bo'Az</span> tries to clarify with <span style="color: Magenta">"Shape Water,"</span> it gets a little clearer, then he hits the <span style="color: Red">hooded figure</span> with a few <span style="color: Magenta">"Magic Missiles."</span></p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> moves up and pushes the last sleeping <span style="color: Red">briggand</span> off the walkway, into the water, he drowns in his sleep. Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha</p>
<p>**  The <span style="color: Red">hooded figure</span> gets to <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> underwater, hits him with the branding iron on the side of the face, and <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> is now unconscious, underwater.</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Harvey</span> bunny hops, attacks, and misses.</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: Yellow">Quinn</span> gets to <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> and tries to get him to land while <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> is rolling a death save.</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Bo'Az</span> hits the <span style="color: Red">hooded figure</span> with a <span style="color: Magenta">"Magic Missile."</span></p>
<p>**  Followed by <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> critting on an <span style="color: Magenta">"Eldritch Blast."</span></p>
<p>**  The <span style="color: Red">hooded figure</span> bunny hops out of the water, attacks <span style="color: LightGreen">Bellesar</span> but misses. And <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> attacks the <span style="color: Red">hooded figure</span>, but misses too.</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Harvey</span> heals <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span>, then bunny hops and falls through the shitty plywood decking.</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: Yellow">Quinn</span> attacks with a dagger, misses. Followed by <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> also missing an attack.</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Bellesar</span> then hits the <span style="color: Red">hooded figure</span> in the knee with a longbow attack.</p>
<p>**  The <span style="color: Red">hooded figure</span> starts to surrender, and tells us some info about the Hags. He also says he'll give our stuff back if we let him go.</p>
<p>**  A random person walks up, points something at the <span style="color: Red">hooded figure</span>, we hear a little explosion and the <span style="color: Red">hooded figure's</span> brains are now out of his head on the ground!</p>
<p>**  Upon looking at this person we see a long dark blue petty coat, and a feather necklace that looks familiar. He holds up an insignia that is recognized by <span style="color: LightGreen">Bo'Az</span> and <span style="color: LightGreen">Harvey</span>. (Icon of the Grey Hunt)</p>
<p>**  He asks for anyone with a firearm to hand it over, and for us to help him find and burn the cache of weapons the <span style="color: Red">briggands</span> stole. His purpose here is to get rid of all firearms and ammunition.</p>
<p>**  After meeting this new person, who introduces himself as <span style="color: Yellow">Weaver</span>, we search the <span style="color: Red">briggand</span> bodies and find some loot.</p>
<p>**  First everyone who had something stolen by the hooded figure gets their items back. Then <span style="color: LightGreen">Harvey</span> gets a shield, <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> gets the branding iron, and we each get 4 gold.</p>
<p>**  Further searching of the chests in the tree stump, we find 200 gold, two (2) sets of Studded leather armor, and Splint mail.</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> then identifies a few items such as the dagger and scarf that the hooded figure possessed.</p>
<p>**  As we discuss setting up a watch and alarm for a long rest, <span style="color: Yellow">Weaver</span> volunteers to watch the whole night to give us all a long rest.</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> uses an <span style="color: Magenta">"Alarm"</span> ritual to make sure we are alerted of any movement near us in the night.</p>
<p>**  In the middle of the night, <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> gets up to harass <span style="color: Yellow">Weaver</span>.</p>
<p>**  In the morning <span style="color: Yellow">Weaver</span> asks what's on our itinerary, and we discuss what we are looking for around here. He then says if we can help keep him alive, and find a way for him to get out of the Feywild, he'll owe us a favor.</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> hears a voice in her head that tells her to ask <span style="color: Yellow">Weaver</span> about Percy and Vex, and their current status.</p>
<p>**  As soon as she mentions their names, <span style="color: Yellow">Weaver</span> pulls out a gun and points it directly at <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span>'s head, to which she pees out of fright. Another name was brought up, to which <span style="color: Yellow">Weaver</span> had nothing but disdain for the person.</p>
<p>**  After threatening to blow <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span>'s brains out, <span style="color: Yellow">Weaver</span> and the group continue in rowboats, piloted by Bullywugs.</p>
<p>**  While in the rowboats, the visible world shrunk to about a 5ft distance on all sides with heavy fog covering everything else.</p>
<p>**  The Bullywugs talk in Sylvan to the group, and <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> communicates with them in their native tongue. She informs the group what the Bullywugs tell her.</p>
<p>**  They want to introduce us to <span style="color: Yellow">King Gullup the 19th.</span></p>
<p>**  Arriving at a small dock near a village on a lake, we see a cabin in the middle of the lake. It's on stilts, and looks like a cabin that was described to us in a previous session.</p>
<p>**  Upon meeting the <span style="color: Yellow">King</span>, <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> searches through her bag and offers a crystal door knob as a gift. He happily accepts!</p>
<p>**  The <span style="color: Yellow">King</span> wants us to return a book to the Hag in the cabin in the middle of the lake. The catch is that he wants us to convince her that he didn't steal it.</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> asks if <span style="color: LightGreen">Harvey</span> can read the book before we return it. (<span style="color: LightGreen">Harvey</span> can't read, lmao!)</p>
<p>**  Looking through the book, <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> finds a lot of shit written about people that <span style="color: Red">Bavlorna</span> hates. And six (6) passages about "The Dark One."</p>
<p>**  <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> adds shit about <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> to the book, and writes "Edited by <span style="color: LightGreen">Harvey</span>" on the first page.</p>
<p>**  After browsing the book and telling the group the important parts, the Bullywugs usher us in to clothing that matches theirs. Then they shove us on what resembles clothing lines that connect to <span style="color: Red">Bavlorna's</span> cabin.</p>
<p>**  They pull the line which moves us towards the cabin.</p>
<p>**  We reach the cabin and get a description of the first room.</p>
