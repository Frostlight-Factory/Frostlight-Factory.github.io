  <h2> 20220323 Session Notes </h2>
  
  
<hr></hr>
<p>** Starting in the Taxidermy Room of <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna's</span> cabin, <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> finds a fox pelt and puts it on like a cape.  <span style="color: LightGreen">Bo'Az</span> finds a Basilisk corpse in a cage and figures out how to get some of the venom out of it's skin.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> also finds a wooden eyeball, and keeps it.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Harvey</span> helps <span style="color: LightGreen">Bo'Az</span> by delicately cutting out the venom sack from the Basilisk.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> starting talking about his stealth numbers. And <span style="color: LightGreen">Harvey</span> asked "Do you measure your stealth in numbers?!"</p>
<p>** <span style="color: Yellow">Weaver</span> put up his hood, and became more difficult to see, then started to move out of the Taxidermy room to see what was ahead.</p>
<p>** While searching the next room with a pool and a well, <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> casts <span style="color: Lavender">"Unseen Servant"</span> to send it to the well.</p>
<p>** Meanwhile <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> walks right up to the well, looks in, and moves away.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: Yellow">Weaver</span> is looking at a mirror on the wall, says "Bandersnatch," and a portal back to the hall of mirrors in the Carnival opens up.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> then sends her unseen servant to the well to reach in, the spell is destroyed as soon as it touches something in the well!</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Harvey</span> casts <span style="color: Lavender">"Mage Hand"</span> and it too gets destroyed trying to grab something in the well.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Bellesar</span> opens up a door to a balcony full of frogs. He goes to grab one, and they all start a loud "CROAK!" in unison.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Harvey</span> keeps seeing shadows move out of the corners of his eyes, and they resemble "Shadow Children" that he has heard about before.</p>
<p>** While <span style="color: LightGreen">Bo'Az</span> is opening another door to a room with a cupboard, <span style="color: LightGreen">Bellesar</span> throws the little, innocent, defenseless frog in to the well. It dies a painful, agonizing death screaming in absolute pain. What a monster!</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Harvey</span> opens the sigil on the cupboard and finds some stuff inside. A rolled up piece of paper that says "Spittlespew."</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Bo'Az</span> looks in a mirror, and his face appears expressionless. Everything else is normal in the mirror, just faces have no expression.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Bo'Az</span> then opens the last door, and it's a fabric room.</p>
<p>** We discuss heading towards the direction that <span style="color: LightGreen">Harvey</span> saw the shadow move, and <span style="color: Yellow">Quinn</span> leads the way.</p>
<p>** Continuing through the cabin, <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> comes to a room with a boiler and a bunch of pipes connected to it. It looks like some kind of magical still. Of course he disturbs it, and someone opens a door on the other side of the room and stares directly at <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span>.</p>
<p>** The potion master, as we come to find out, introduces himself as <span style="color: Yellow">Crow</span>.</p>
<p>** We talk for a min or two, then he asks to see the book we brought to return to <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna</span>.</p>
<p>** While <span style="color: Yellow">Crow</span> and <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> are talking about the book, <span style="color: LightGreen">Harvey</span> uses <span style="color: Lavender">"Mage Hand"</span> to remove the fox pelt off of her.</p>
<p>** We talk more to <span style="color: Yellow">Crow</span> and ask if we can help free him from the Hags service and control.</p>
<p>** He informs us that the frogs on the balcony were an alarm, a collective "OOOHHHH" was heard, and <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna</span> already knows we're here.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: Yellow">Crow</span> knows about <span style="color: Yellow">Kaylen</span> and <span style="color: Yellow">Ragnar</span>, and where they are located.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: Yellow">Crow</span> then talked about ambushing <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna</span> to kill her, as that's the only way he'll be free. </p>
<p>** He also informs us that "Widdershins" is a dance, and he reluctantly shows us how to do it.</p>
<p>** He also tells us about the ritual in progress to turn our once companions in to Hags.</p>
<p>** While preparing for the fight with <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna</span>, he mixes some of his blood with the Basilisk venom to make a "Potion of Hag Slaying" for some of our weapons.</p>
<p>** Walking through the kitchen on the way to <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna's</span> chambers, we help the butcher,<span style="color: Yellow">Bloody Shoes</span>, catch the vultures he's chasing. <span style="color: Yellow">Crow</span> then tells him to take the rest of the day off and go somewhere else.</p>
<p>** Reaching <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna's</span> room, <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen's</span> stuffed crab crawls up <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna's</span> shoulder and starts talking to him!</p>
<p>** As soon as that happens, he wants to start a fight to get his crab back. Even though it has been awakened by <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna</span>.</p>
<p>** <b>ROLL INIATIVE!</b></p>
<p>** <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna's Quicklings</span> act first and attack <span style="color: LightGreen">Harvey</span> six (6) times! He feels the pain!</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> then <span style="color: Lavender">"Hexes"</span> <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna</span> and puts a <span style="color: Lavender">"Shatter"</span> to hit her and a <span style="color: Salmon">Darkling Eldar</span>.</p>
<p>** Next <span style="color: LightGreen">Bo'Az</span> shoots a quickened <span style="color: Lavender">"Magic Missile"</span> and kills one <span style="color: Salmon">Quickling</span> before shooting his crossbow at another but missing.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna</span> looks at <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span>, says "You look tasty..." then she hops over and swallows <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> whole!</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> immediately falls unconscious in <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna's</span> belly from the acid damage.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Harvey</span> attacks another  <span style="color: Salmon">Quickling</span> before inspiring <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span>.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Bellesar</span> casts <span style="color: Lavender">"Toll the Dead"</span> on <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna</span> and crits on the damage!</p>
<p>** Getting into the fight now, <span style="color: Yellow">Crow</span> casts <span style="color: Lavender">"Scorching Ray"</span> and hits <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna</span>.</p>
<p>** Using the power of the Rune Knight, <span style="color: Yellow">Quinn</span> grows in size before reaching in <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna's</span> mouth to try and rescue <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span>.</p>
<p>** The acid damage hurts, but isn't enough to keep him from pulling <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> out before she gets dissolved inside <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna</span>.</p>
<p>** Trying to jump in and help <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna</span>, the <span style="color: Salmon">Darkling Eldar</span> casts <span style="color: Lavender">"Darkness"</span> that covers everyone in the room except <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> and <span style="color: Yellow">Crow</span>.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> attacks the <span style="color: Salmon">Darkling Eldar</span> with his spear and adds a <span style="color: Lavender">"Branding Smite"</span>.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Bo'Az</span> quickly heals <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> as much as he can before moving away from <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna</span>.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna</span> then spits out two (2) more <span style="color: Salmon">Quicklings</span>, and <span style="color: Yellow">Quinn</span> gets six (6) attacks from the surrounding <span style="color: Salmon">Quicklings</span>.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> <span style="color: Lavender">"Misty Steps"</span>away to get out of harms way while she heals more.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Harvey</span> then inspires <span style="color: LightGreen">Bellesar</span> before hopping away to safety himself.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Bellesar</span> attacks <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna</span> with his <span style="color: Lavender">"Spiritual Weapon"</span> followed by <span style="color: Yellow">Crow</span> shooting a few <span style="color: Lavender">"Magic Missiles"</span> at her.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: Yellow">Quinn</span> then starts punching the <span style="color: Salmon">Quicklings</span>.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> moves up to attack <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna</span> with his trident before trying to bite her.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Bo'Az</span> <span style="color: Lavender">"Magic Missiles"</span> <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna</span> before she <span style="color: Lavender">"Polymorphs"</span>herself into a <span style="color: Salmon">Great Ape</span>.</p>
<p>** The <span style="color: Salmon">Quicklings</span> attack <span style="color: LightGreen">Bo'Az</span>.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> calls forth a <span style="color: Lavender">"Phantasmal Force"</span> in the form of a Poacher pointing a gun directly at the <span style="color: Salmon">Great Ape</span>.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Harvey</span> moves up to stab the <span style="color: Salmon">Great Ape</span> before <span style="color: LightGreen">Bellesar</span> calls <span style="color: Lavender">"Toll the Dead"</span> on it.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: Yellow">Crow</span> then causes the <span style="color: Lavender">"Polymorph"</span> to drop on <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna</span> with a <span style="color: Lavender">"Scorching Ray"</span> attack.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: Yellow">Quinn</span> Death Save.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> misses a trident attack before biting <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna</span>. It hurts, but she likes it!</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Bo'Az</span> then shoots more <span style="color: Lavender">"Magic Missiles"</span> at her.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna</span> turns to attack <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> but misses.</p>
<p>** The <span style="color: Salmon">Quicklings</span> continue attacking <span style="color: LightGreen">Bo'Az</span>.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Harvey</span> calls <span style="color: Lavender">"Cure Wounds"</span> on <span style="color: Yellow">Quinn</span> before inspiring <span style="color: LightGreen">Bellesar</span>.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Bellesar</span> casts <span style="color: Lavender">"Toll the Dead"</span> again before attacking her with his <span style="color: Lavender">"Spiritual Weapon"</span>.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: Yellow">Crow</span> tries a spell attack, but fails.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: Yellow">Quinn</span> stands up, and stabs <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna</span> with a dagger.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span> hits her with a <span style="color: Lavender">"Branding Smite"</span> to the side of the face.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Bo'Az</span> uses some sorcery to be able to cast one last <span style="color: Lavender">"Magic Missile"</span>, and it works! <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna</span> is dead!</p>
<p>** As soon as she is killed, the remaining <span style="color: Salmon">Quicklings</span> disappear.</p>
<p>** <b>DING! LEVEL UP! {5}</b></p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Bellesar</span> finds an Iron Key on <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna</span>.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: Yellow">Crow</span> casts <span style="color: Lavender">"Cure Wounds"</span> on <span style="color: Yellow">Kaylen</span> before opening up the potion cabinet <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> found. Inside are three (3) potions, one to shrink, one to grow, and one to vanish.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: Yellow">Kaylen</span> and <span style="color: Yellow">Ragnar</span> get up, we help them find their gear and items and get suited up. We talk about what happened the night they disappeared, the <span style="color: Salmon">Darkling Eldar</span> is what grabbed them with claws from the bridge.</p>
<p>** Mr. Crabs talks to <span style="color: LightGreen">Zaylen</span>, but doesn't want to be his companion anymore. lol</p>
<p>** We make it to <span style="color: Salmon">Bavlorna's</span> bed room and find a locked chest. <span style="color: Yellow">Crow</span> opens it with a <span style="color: Lavender">"Knock"</span> and inside are three (3) spell scrolls of <span style="color: Lavender">"Identify"</span> and a signed, un-punched carnival ticket.</p>
<p>** We make it to another room, both Iron Keys the group has opens the door, we see a large frog statue in the corner, and we find a Helmet of Telepathy, which <span style="color: LightGreen">Harvey</span> claims.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Bo'Az</span> sitcks his hand in the frogs mouth, and pulls it out with no ill effects.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Vellia</span> sticks her hand inside, and pulls out a little stick, 2" long, and it feels very magical. She then gets help to pull the magic out of the stick and gains her missing height back!</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Bo'Az</span> then tells <span style="color: Yellow">Kaylen</span> he can probably get his humanity back if he sticks his hand in the frog's mouth. <span style="color: Yellow">Kaylen</span>  sticks his hand in, and pulls it out with his middle finger flicking off <span style="color: LightGreen">Bo'Az</span>.</p>
<p>** Learning about the mirror out of the Feywild, and back into the carnival, <span style="color: Yellow">Quinn</span>, and <span style="color: Yellow">Ragnar</span> decide they are leaving as soon as they can, and ask <span style="color: LightGreen">Bo'Az</span> to go with them.</p>
<p>** <span style="color: LightGreen">Bo'Az</span> declines and stays with his new friends.</p>
