<p><h3>6 Questions to ask:</h3>
<ul class="b" style="text-align: left;border: 2px solid powderblue;padding: 22px;margin: 9px 199px 9px 199px">
  <li>Is this character a hero? Why or why not?</li>

<li>Start your character with a random trinket. Minor and tangible. Good resource is D&D 5E Player Handbook.</li>

<li>What did the character do, how did they live their life, before becoming an adventurer? </li>
</ul>

<p><h3>Fleshing out characters:</h3>
<ul class="b" style="text-align: left;border: 2px solid powderblue;padding: 22px;margin: 9px 99px 9px 99px">
<li>Physical description - not just how they look, but also how they move and carry themselves.</li>
<li>Mannerisms - do they clench their jaw, wring their hands, roll their feet when they walk</li>
<li>Worldview - </li>
<li>Pain points - </li>
<li>Desires - </li>
<li>Fears and phobias - </li>
</ul>
 </p>
